# M6 Historical Exercise-Mapping Behavior Options (Brainstorm)

## Purpose

Compare candidate behaviors for how analytics should interpret exercise-to-muscle mappings after a user edits an exercise mapping later.

This brainstorm is intended to support `docs/tasks/complete/T-20260224-05-m6-historical-mapping-behavior-options.md` (the historical-mapping task; note the task is `-05`, not `-04`).

## Decision status (locked)

- Date locked: `2026-02-25`
- Canonical analytics for completed sessions must be reproducible and must not drift due to later exercise-mapping edits.
- Default implementation target for the first analytics milestone: `snapshot at session completion`.
- `Versioned mappings` remains an escalation path if analytics requirements justify the added complexity (audit/history UX, heavy recalculation workflows, or concurrent-edit/version semantics).

## Context / constraints (current)

- M6 locked `non-normalized` exercise-to-muscle weights.
- M6 intentionally deferred historical behavior for completed sessions.
- Analytics implementation is out of scope in M6, but this decision affects future schema/API design.
- Architecture is local-first with planned sync/outbox; avoid decisions that create avoidable sync complexity unless they buy clear product value.
- Stable muscle-group IDs are expected; display labels may evolve.

## Problem statement

If a user edits the muscle links/weights for an exercise (for example changing `triceps` from `0.5` to `0.3` on a press), what should happen to analytics for already completed sessions that used that exercise?

## Candidate options

1. `Snapshot at log time` (or completion-time freeze)
- Store the effective mapping used by the completed session.
- Past analytics read the stored snapshot, not the current exercise definition.

2. `Versioned mappings`
- Exercise mappings are versioned over time.
- Completed sessions reference the mapping version in effect when logged/completed.

3. `Recompute using latest mapping`
- Completed sessions do not preserve historical mapping.
- Analytics always read the current mapping on the exercise definition.

## Evaluation criteria

- Implementation complexity (local schema + future backend)
- Storage cost
- User expectations / trust
- Analytics reproducibility
- Migration risk
- Sync/API complexity
- Ability to correct bad mappings later

## Compare / contrast summary

| Option | Complexity | Storage | User expectation fit | Reproducibility | Sync/API impact | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Snapshot | Medium | Medium-high | High | High | Medium | Best v1 balance if stable analytics are desired |
| Versioned | High | Medium | High | High | High | Strong long-term model, highest design/ops cost |
| Recompute latest | Low | Low | Low-medium | Low | Low | Fastest, but past analytics drift after edits |

## Detailed tradeoffs

### Option 1: Snapshot at log time (recommended default candidate)

How it works:

- When a session becomes `completed` (or when an exercise instance is finalized), persist the exercise-to-muscle mapping that was effective at that time.
- Analytics for completed sessions read the snapshot, even if the source exercise mapping later changes.

Pros:

- Matches common user expectation: past workouts should not change unexpectedly.
- Strong reproducibility for analytics, debugging, and future recalculation audits.
- Simpler than a full version graph; no version lifecycle rules required.
- Compatible with local-first/offline behavior (freeze locally at completion, sync later).

Cons:

- Duplicates mapping data across completed sessions (storage growth).
- Requires new snapshot storage schema and write path during completion/finalization.
- Bug fixes to a mapping do not automatically back-correct historical analytics (requires explicit repair/rebuild tooling if desired).

High-level schema implications:

- Add a completed-session historical mapping record (likely per logged session exercise, not global exercise definition).
- Snapshot must include at least:
  - effective `exercise_definition_id`
  - `muscle_group_id`
  - `weight`
  - optional `role`
- Consider a session exercise level anchor (for example `session_exercise_id`) so edits to exercise definitions do not affect linkage.
- Define when snapshot is frozen:
  - recommended: on session completion (not every in-progress draft change)

Migration/sync risks:

- Future sync payloads increase (completed sessions carry snapshot rows).
- Need idempotent completion logic so retries do not duplicate snapshots.
- Backfill needed only if analytics is introduced before snapshot rollout and legacy completed sessions exist.

### Option 2: Versioned mappings

How it works:

- Maintain version history for exercise mappings (for example `exercise_definition_id + version`).
- A completed session points to the version used at the time.

Pros:

- Reproducible like snapshots.
- More storage-efficient than per-session snapshots when many sessions share the same mapping version.
- Supports richer audit/history features later ("what changed and when").
- Can distinguish mapping corrections from session data changes cleanly.

Cons:

- Highest implementation complexity (version lifecycle, immutability, active version switching, migration rules).
- Harder sync/conflict model in a local-first system (concurrent edits, version assignment ordering).
- More API and schema surface area before analytics value is proven.
- Requires clear policy for system exercise mapping updates vs user exercise mapping edits.

High-level schema implications:

- New versioned mapping tables/entities (header + rows, or version field with immutable rows).
- Session exercise records need `mapping_version_id` (or equivalent) persisted at completion/log time.
- Mutation flow must create new versions instead of updating rows in place.
- Need active/current version pointer for exercise definitions.

Migration/sync risks:

- More complex migrations from current mutable `exercise_muscle_mappings` model.
- Sync conflicts become semantic (simultaneous edits create multiple candidate versions).
- Harder to keep local + backend version IDs stable if backend arrives later.

### Option 3: Recompute using latest mapping

How it works:

- Keep only the current exercise mapping on the exercise definition.
- Analytics for all sessions join against the latest mapping.

Pros:

- Simplest schema and implementation.
- Minimal storage cost.
- Easy to apply mapping corrections globally.
- Lowest sync/API complexity.

Cons:

- Past analytics drift after edits; user may lose trust if history changes unexpectedly.
- Poor reproducibility for debugging, experiments, and "why did this chart change?" questions.
- Makes analytics outputs depend on mutable reference data rather than completed session facts.

High-level schema implications:

- No new historical schema needed.
- Analytics queries join `session -> session_exercise -> current exercise_muscle_mappings`.

Migration/sync risks:

- Few schema risks.
- Product risk is high if expectations later force a switch to snapshot/versioned after analytics launches.

## Edge cases to decide regardless of option

1. Freeze point for history: first set log, exercise added to session, or session completion.
- Recommended default: `session completion`.

2. In-progress sessions and edits:
- If a mapping changes while a session is still in progress, should the session use the latest mapping until completion, or preserve mapping at first use?
- Recommended default: latest mapping until completion, then freeze.

3. System mapping corrections:
- If the team fixes a bad system exercise mapping, should historical analytics change automatically?
- Recommended product posture: no automatic change to completed-session canonical analytics; allow future explicit reprocessing tools if needed.

4. Taxonomy label changes vs ID changes:
- Label changes are safe (IDs stable).
- ID removals/merges require explicit migration strategy under any reproducible option.

## Locked decision (from this comparison)

### Policy decision

- Reject `recompute using latest mapping` as the default/canonical historical behavior for completed-session analytics.
- Prefer a reproducible model for canonical analytics.

### Default implementation target for first analytics milestone

- Use `snapshot at session completion` as the v1 implementation target.
- Defer full `versioned mappings` unless a near-term requirement emerges for:
  - mapping audit trails visible to users/admins
  - efficient global reprocessing across many sessions
  - explicit "mapping changed on date X" semantics

Why this is the best near-term tradeoff:

- It preserves user trust and analytics stability.
- It is materially simpler than versioning in a local-first + future sync architecture.
- It can evolve later toward versioning (snapshot rows can carry optional provenance metadata such as source exercise mapping row IDs / timestamps).

## Recommended decision path / trigger

1. Lock now at the policy level:
- Canonical analytics for completed sessions must be reproducible and must not drift due to later mapping edits.

2. Defer exact schema shape to analytics kickoff, but narrow the implementation choices to:
- `snapshot at completion` (default)
- `versioned mappings` (only if analytics milestone requirements justify extra complexity)

3. Trigger to revisit versioning before implementation:
- If analytics scope requires mapping change history/audit UI, cross-device concurrent exercise editing, or large-scale recalculation workflows, re-open `versioned mappings`.

## Follow-on task implications (for future task card writers)

- Analytics milestone task should explicitly include:
  - canonical historical behavior = reproducible
  - freeze point = session completion (unless changed)
  - backfill strategy for pre-snapshot completed sessions (if any exist)
  - sync contract impact for historical mapping snapshots
- If snapshot is chosen, add a task for historical snapshot schema + completion write-path before analytics rollups.
- If versioning is chosen, split work into:
  - versioned mapping schema/model
  - editor mutation/version lifecycle
  - session linkage to mapping version
  - analytics reads

## Open questions (worth answering before locking)

- Do we want a future "recalculate all history with latest mappings" view as an optional non-canonical report?
- Should completed-session snapshots store only mapping rows, or also copy exercise display name for audit readability?
- Is there any expected need to edit mappings for system exercises differently than user-created exercises in analytics history?
