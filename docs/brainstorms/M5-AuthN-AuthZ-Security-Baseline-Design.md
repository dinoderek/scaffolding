# M5 AuthN/Z + Security Baseline Design (Brainstorm v1)

## Purpose

Design proposal for `T-20260220-10` before implementation.  
Focus: MVP user identity model on `Supabase`, auth flows, authorization (`RLS`), provisioning, and security baseline.

## Inputs / constraints (current)

- Backend platform is locked to `Supabase (Auth + Postgres + RLS)`.
- FE auth UI integration is out of scope for this task.
- M5 requires real backend-enforced user ownership for sync-domain tables.
- Local-first verification is required (Supabase local stack + deterministic fixtures).
- User preferences for this design pass:
  - investigate Supabase auth options first, then choose MVP subset
  - no self-signup
  - redundant ownership columns on child tables are acceptable
  - `gyms` remain user-private in MVP
  - Supabase built-in auth rate limiting + config hardening is sufficient baseline (no custom rate limiter in M5)
  - logging/audit policy should be minimal and explicit

## Supabase Auth capability scan (out-of-the-box)

Supabase Auth supports, out of the box:

- password-based auth
- email passwordless auth (magic link / OTP)
- phone auth (OTP with provider integration)
- social OAuth providers
- SSO
- JWT-based sessions that integrate with Postgres `RLS`
- admin user management APIs (`createUser`, invites, etc.) using server-only credentials

## M5 recommendation (auth method + posture)

### Auth methods enabled in M5

- `Email + password` only

### Auth methods disabled in M5

- public self-signup
- magic link / email OTP
- phone OTP
- OAuth/social login
- anonymous sign-in

### Why this subset

- Smallest path to prove auth works end-to-end with deterministic local tests.
- Avoids redirect/deep-link and email-template complexity before FE auth integration.
- Avoids passwordless auto-signup edge cases while self-signup is intentionally disabled.
- Keeps security posture explicit: only pre-provisioned users can authenticate.

## User identity model (auth linkage) - options and recommendation

### Option A: Direct ownership FKs to `auth.users(id)` (recommended for M5)

Pattern:

- App-owned tables store `owner_user_id uuid not null references auth.users(id)`.
- `RLS` policies use `auth.uid()` to compare against `owner_user_id`.
- No app profile table is required for MVP authz.

Pros:

- Minimal schema and migration scope.
- Simplest `RLS` policy expressions.
- Fewer triggers / sync points between auth schema and app schema.
- Fastest path for M5 authz + sync API ownership enforcement.

Cons:

- App tables are directly coupled to `auth.users`.
- If we later want app-specific user metadata, we add another table later (`profiles`) and backfill references only where needed.

### Option B: App profile table (`app_public.user_profiles` or `profiles`) + app FKs to profile PK

Pattern:

- Create app table keyed by `auth.users(id)` (1:1).
- App-owned tables FK to `app_public.user_profiles(id)`.
- Often paired with a trigger on auth user creation.

Pros:

- Cleaner boundary for app-specific metadata and lifecycle.
- Avoids sprinkling direct `auth.*` joins through app queries.
- Better long-term foundation if user-facing profile features are near-term.

Cons:

- Extra table + trigger + backfill behavior to design/test now.
- More moving parts before M5 sync APIs exist.
- Does not materially improve MVP row ownership enforcement versus direct FK.

### Recommendation

- Use **Option A** in M5: direct `owner_user_id -> auth.users(id)` on app-owned tables.
- Defer `profiles` until a concrete app metadata need exists (display name, avatar, preferences, group/public profile, etc.).
- Document an explicit migration path to add `app_public.user_profiles` later with `id = auth.users.id` if needed.

## Ownership model (MVP sync tables)

Tables in scope for M5/M5.5 sync foundation:

- `gyms`
- `sessions`
- `session_exercises`
- `exercise_sets`

### Ownership decision

- All four tables store redundant `owner_user_id`.
- `gyms` are user-private only in MVP.

### Why redundant ownership on child tables

- Simpler and faster `RLS` predicates (`owner_user_id = auth.uid()`) on every table.
- Easier direct querying/filtering without nested joins.
- Cleaner negative-path tests per resource family.
- Better operational debuggability (owner visible on every row).

### Integrity requirement (important)

Because ownership is redundant, DB constraints must prevent mismatches.

Recommended schema pattern:

- `sessions(owner_user_id)` references `auth.users(id)`
- `session_exercises(owner_user_id)` references `auth.users(id)`
- `exercise_sets(owner_user_id)` references `auth.users(id)`
- composite FK from child to parent including owner:
  - `session_exercises (session_id, owner_user_id)` -> `sessions (id, owner_user_id)`
  - `exercise_sets (session_exercise_id, owner_user_id)` -> `session_exercises (id, owner_user_id)`
- composite FK for user-private gym link:
  - `sessions (gym_id, owner_user_id)` -> `gyms (id, owner_user_id)` (with nullable `gym_id` handling)

This avoids cross-user references even if an application bug tries to attach a child row to another user's parent row.

## Schema placement and API exposure

### Proposed schema placement

- Keep app-owned sync tables in `app_public` (already reserved in baseline migration).
- Keep dev-only fixtures in `public` (current `dev_fixture_principals` is acceptable for local tooling/tests).

### API exposure posture (for M5/M5.5)

- Expose only app-owned schema(s) needed by the API surface (`app_public`) when required.
- Do not expose `auth` schema.
- `RLS` enabled on all app-owned tables before any client-facing data access path is considered complete.

## Authentication flow design (M5, no FE UI yet)

### Supported user lifecycle in M5

1. Admin/operator provisions a user (local or hosted).
2. User signs in with email/password.
3. Requests include access token.
4. DB authorization is enforced by `RLS` using `auth.uid()`.
5. Sign-out invalidates local session on client (FE integration deferred).

### Provisioning mechanism (M5)

Primary path (recommended):

- Use a **server-only admin provisioning script** (service-role key) for local/dev/test and hosted environments.
- Support actions like:
  - create user
  - optionally set password
  - auto-confirm email for controlled provisioning
  - idempotent "ensure user exists" by email

Fallback/ops path:

- Supabase Dashboard admin user creation/invite for manual operations.

Rationale:

- Scripted provisioning is repeatable and testable.
- Dashboard remains useful for emergency/manual ops but should not be the only path.

## Local deterministic auth fixtures (`user_a`, `user_b`) - recommendation

### Recommendation (hybrid, practical)

Use **real local Supabase Auth users** for auth/integration tests, with deterministic fixture aliases:

- `user_a` and `user_b` are real local auth accounts with known test credentials.
- Tests authenticate through real Supabase Auth (sign-in success/failure) to validate actual session issuance.
- `public.dev_fixture_principals` remains the alias registry (`user_a`, `user_b`, etc.) for repeatable tests and human-readable ownership fixtures.

### UUID determinism recommendation

- Prefer deterministic aliases (`user_a`, `user_b`) as the hard requirement.
- If fixed UUIDs can be reliably assigned during provisioning, keep that behavior.
- If not, make the provisioning script authoritative for writing/updating `dev_fixture_principals.subject_uuid` after creating/auth reconciling local users.

Reason:

- Auth correctness tests should use real Auth flows.
- Rigid dependence on pre-seeded hardcoded UUIDs is less important than stable fixture identities and repeatable setup.
- Avoid direct writes to `auth.*` internals unless local-only and clearly isolated, because it is more brittle than admin APIs.

## Authorization design (`RLS` + DB constraints)

## Policy posture

- `RLS` enabled on every user-owned table in scope.
- Deny-by-default (no broad allow policies).
- Only authenticated users can access app-owned tables.
- `anon` has no read/write access to user-owned rows.

### Baseline policy shape (conceptual)

For each user-owned table:

- `SELECT`: allow where `owner_user_id = auth.uid()`
- `INSERT`: allow where `owner_user_id = auth.uid()`
- `UPDATE`: allow where existing row `owner_user_id = auth.uid()` and new row `owner_user_id = auth.uid()`
- `DELETE`: allow where `owner_user_id = auth.uid()`

### Additional hardening

- Make `owner_user_id` immutable after insert (trigger or `WITH CHECK` + update restrictions).
- Prefer DB constraints/defaults that reduce trust in API handlers.
- Keep cross-user denial enforceable even if custom API handler guards regress.

## Service-role / anon / authenticated boundaries

### `anon` key

- Safe for mobile/client use.
- Grants API access but no protected data without valid user JWT and matching `RLS`.

### `authenticated` role (user JWT)

- Used for normal app data access.
- Scoped by `RLS`.

### `service_role` key

- Server-only / admin-only.
- Never shipped in mobile app.
- Used only for provisioning scripts, admin maintenance, and tightly scoped server tasks.

### JWT secret / signing keys

- Never exposed to mobile app or client bundles.
- Local-only test helpers may use local JWT signing secret for test tooling if needed, but keep this isolated to backend-local scripts/tests.

## Security baseline (M5)

### Input validation

- Validate all custom API inputs at the boundary (Edge Function or server handler) using explicit schemas.
- For direct `PostgREST` writes, rely on DB constraints + `RLS` + narrow API surface; add RPC wrappers if validation needs grow.
- Reject unknown fields where practical for custom handlers.

### Auth endpoint hardening (M5)

- Disable public self-signup.
- Disable unused providers/methods.
- Use Supabase built-in auth rate-limit settings (no custom rate limiter in M5).
- Prefer controlled provisioning with auto-confirm (admin path) instead of public email confirmation flows.

### Secrets handling

- No `service_role` in mobile app or client-exposed configs.
- Separate local vs hosted env files (already scaffolded).
- Document key usage boundaries in `supabase/README.md` and any future FE auth integration doc.

### Minimal logging / audit policy (proposed)

Allowed to log:

- request path / function name
- request ID / correlation ID
- status code / error code
- authenticated user UUID (if needed for debugging)
- validation error summary (field names, not values, when sensitive)

Do not log:

- passwords
- access tokens / refresh tokens / JWTs
- `Authorization` headers
- raw auth request bodies
- service-role keys / secrets
- full email addresses in error logs (redact or hash when possible)

### Error response discipline

- Return generic auth failure messages to clients where enumeration risk exists.
- Keep detailed error context in server-side logs only (with redaction).

## Config posture to document/implement in M5 (Supabase)

High-level config intent (exact file values may differ by environment):

- `[auth].enable_signup = false`
- `[auth.email].enable_signup = false`
- `[auth].enable_anonymous_sign_ins = false`
- disable unused providers for M5
- keep refresh token rotation enabled
- keep/tune Supabase auth rate limits (document chosen values)
- set explicit `site_url` / redirect URLs even if password-only (future-proofing, avoid surprises later)

## Testing and verification design for `T-20260220-10`

### Required test categories

1. Auth success/failure tests
- valid email/password signs in and yields session
- invalid password fails
- disabled self-signup path is rejected

2. `RLS` ownership success tests
- `user_a` can CRUD own rows
- `user_b` can CRUD own rows

3. Cross-user denial tests (must-have)
- `user_b` cannot read/update/delete `user_a` rows for each protected resource family
- child insert with mismatched parent owner is rejected (constraint and/or `RLS`)

4. Unauthenticated denial tests
- `anon` cannot access protected rows

5. Service-role/admin boundary tests (minimal)
- provisioning/admin script path works with service role
- confirm service-role credentials are not required for normal user data-path tests

### Local fixture/test setup notes

- Run `./supabase/scripts/reset-local.sh` before suites that depend on policies/schema changes.
- Add an idempotent local auth fixture provisioning step before auth/authz integration tests.
- Keep fixture identities named (`user_a`, `user_b`) and documented in one place.

## Future-ready but out of scope (document only)

- FE auth screens and session persistence integration
- social/OAuth login
- passwordless login (magic link/OTP)
- group/shared-resource authorization rules
- app profile table (`profiles`) unless a concrete feature requires it
- advanced audit pipelines / SIEM integration
- custom auth abuse controls beyond Supabase config defaults

## Proposed implementation order (for the actual coding task)

1. Define/land schema ownership model (`owner_user_id`, constraints, `RLS` enablement) for M5 tables in scope.
2. Configure auth posture (disable signup and unused providers/methods in local config + docs).
3. Add admin provisioning script for local/hosted controlled user creation.
4. Add local auth fixture provisioning for `user_a` / `user_b`.
5. Implement `RLS` policies and ownership integrity constraints.
6. Add auth/authz contract tests (success, unauth, cross-user denial).
7. Document security baseline checklist and key-scope boundaries.

## Open questions / assumptions to validate during implementation

- Whether local auth fixture provisioning can reliably assign fixed UUIDs via admin APIs; if not, fixture alias determinism is sufficient.
- Whether M5 sync API in `T-20260220-11` will use mostly `PostgREST/RPC` or Edge Functions (affects where input validation is concentrated, but not the ownership model).
