# T-20260225-12 Brainstorm: Simplest Quality-Gate Setup

## Goal

Define the simplest possible local quality-gate setup that:

- gives us a one-stop command path for common fast checks,
- keeps task-specific higher-risk checks explicit,
- fits the current repo structure (`apps/mobile`, `supabase`),
- and is easy to document consistently in task cards while CI is absent.

## Working model (proposed)

Categorize checks along these dimensions:

1. `Speed`
- `fast`
- `slow` (current; examples include `Maestro` and backend contract suites)

2. `Area`
- `frontend` (`apps/mobile`)
- `backend` (`supabase`)
- `e2e` (future, cross-stack)

3. `Environment` (future expansion)
- `local` (default now)
- `deployed`

This gives a simple mental model without overcommitting to CI tooling yet.

## Simplest v1 recommendation

Start with a **small repo-level gate wrapper set** based on the matrix:

- `quality-fast` (default local fast lane)
- `quality-slow` (default local slow lane)
- optional area-specific targets for both (`frontend`, `backend`)

### Canonical concept

- `quality-fast` = "run all applicable local fast checks"
- `quality-slow` = "run all applicable local slow checks"
- area-specific variants for targeted use:
  - `quality-fast frontend`
  - `quality-fast backend`
  - `quality-slow frontend`
  - `quality-slow backend`

Because there is no repo-root `package.json` today, the simplest implementation surface is likely a repo-level shell wrapper (for example under `scripts/`).

## What "fast" should mean (v1)

`Fast` should cover repeatable, low-friction checks that are expected before task closeout for touched code areas.

### Frontend fast (current reality)

- `cd apps/mobile && npm run lint`
- `cd apps/mobile && npm run typecheck`
- `cd apps/mobile && npm run test`

### Backend fast (current reality)

- `./supabase/scripts/test-fast.sh`

Notes:
- This matches current backend-local baseline wrappers already documented.
- It avoids forcing a Node-style `lint/typecheck/test` shape onto `supabase/**` work that does not have a backend Node workspace.

## What "slow" should mean (v1)

`Slow` should cover higher-confidence checks that are still local and repeatable, but slower / heavier than routine fast gates.

### Frontend slow (current reality)

- `cd apps/mobile && npm run test:e2e:ios:smoke`
- `cd apps/mobile && npm run test:e2e:ios:data-smoke`

Notes:
- These are currently best classified as `frontend` simulator/runtime checks (not cross-stack `e2e` yet).
- Repo-level `e2e` remains a future area for true cross-stack orchestration.

### Backend slow (current reality)

- `./supabase/scripts/test-auth-authz.sh`
- `./supabase/scripts/test-sync-api-contract.sh`

Notes:
- These are local backend contract suites and fit naturally in `backend + slow`.
- For backend auth/RLS/API tasks, it is reasonable to run them every time before closeout.

## Explicit non-goal for v1 (important)

Do **not** make `quality-fast` a replacement for task-specific required checks.

Examples that may be covered by `quality-slow` but should still remain **task-card-triggered** when risk-specific:

- `quality-slow backend` (auth/RLS/API contract suites)
- `quality-slow frontend` (Maestro simulator smoke/data smoke)
- hosted/deployed smoke checks

Rationale:
- the standard gate should reduce checklist duplication, not hide risk-based verification triggers.
- task cards should say when `quality-slow` is mandatory vs optional for the change.

## Proposed command/rules shape (lean)

### Usage model

- During development:
  - run targeted checks for the changed runtime/area.
- Before task closeout:
  - run `quality-fast` (defaults to all current areas).
- Then run `quality-slow` for the touched area(s) when required by task/card triggers.
- Then run any remaining task-specific/manual gates required by the task card (especially hosted/deployed smoke).

### Simplest behavior for v1

Prefer **default-all with optional area overrides**, not git-diff auto-detection yet.

Why:
- easier to implement and explain,
- avoids edge cases around uncommitted changes / docs-only changes / partial staging,
- keeps behavior deterministic for AI + human use.

Example behavior:

- `quality-fast` -> runs frontend + backend fast gates if those areas exist
- `quality-slow` -> runs frontend + backend slow gates if those areas exist
- `quality-fast frontend` -> only frontend fast gate
- `quality-fast backend` -> only backend fast gate
- `quality-slow frontend` -> only frontend slow gate
- `quality-slow backend` -> only backend slow gate

## Naming options (recommendation + fallback)

### Recommended

- `quality-fast` (human-readable, matches task language "quality gate")

### Acceptable alternatives

- `verify-fast`
- `test-fast-all` (less ideal because lint/typecheck are not tests)

If we later add a richer matrix, we can extend without breaking the mental model:

- `quality-fast`
- `quality-slow`
- `quality-fast frontend`
- `quality-fast backend`
- `quality-slow frontend`
- `quality-slow backend`
- future: `quality-fast e2e` / `quality-slow e2e`

## Documentation impact (what this would simplify)

Task cards and playbook/docs can reference:

- "Run standard local fast gate (`quality-fast`)"
- "Run `quality-slow <area>` when the task's risk triggers require it"
- plus a short list of truly task-specific/manual checks (for example hosted smoke)

This should reduce repeated command lists while keeping backend non-Node equivalents clear.

## Documentation sync requirement (important)

When this is implemented, update these together and keep wording aligned with minimal repetition:

1. task templates (`docs/specs/templates/task-card-template.md`)
2. AI dev guidelines (`docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`)
3. testing policies (`docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md`)

Rule of thumb:
- define the model once (playbook/testing strategy),
- task templates reference the model and require task-specific triggers/overrides,
- task cards list only deltas and mandatory extra checks.

## Open questions to resolve before implementation

Resolved from review comments:

1. `quality-fast` should default to **all current areas** (`frontend + backend`).
2. Naming preference is `quality-fast`.

Still to confirm:

1. Backend slow cadence:
- should `quality-slow backend` be a default closeout gate for all backend code changes, or only when a task card explicitly marks auth/RLS/API risk triggers?
2. Preferred command surface for v1 (my call: repo-root shell wrappers):
- repo-root `scripts/quality-fast.sh` and `scripts/quality-slow.sh`
- or introduce a repo-root `package.json` just to expose `npm run quality:fast` / `npm run quality:slow`?

Resolution from follow-up:

1. Backend `quality-slow` should be **task-card-triggered** (for auth/RLS/API risk triggers), not a universal backend closeout default.

## Bias / recommendation summary

If we optimize for simplicity and low churn:

- implement repo-level shell wrappers for `quality-fast` and `quality-slow`,
- default both to all current areas and support optional `frontend|backend` area args,
- default to local environment,
- treat current `Maestro` flows as `frontend + slow`,
- treat backend auth/RLS/API contract suites as `backend + slow`,
- keep hosted/deployed checks explicit outside the local gate wrappers,
- document the matrix concept now (`speed x area`, `environment` later) and update playbook/testing/template docs together to stay in sync.
