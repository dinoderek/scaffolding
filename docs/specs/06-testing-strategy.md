# Testing Strategy (High-Level)

## Purpose

Define the top-level testing stack and working practices for MVP.

## Decisions and rationale

1. `Vitest` for unit/domain tests.
Reason: fast feedback loop for logic-heavy parts like set/session calculations and sync state behavior.

2. `React Native Testing Library + jest-expo` for UI/component tests.
Reason: validates real screen behavior with React Native-friendly tooling.

3. `Data layer integration tests` against local SQLite schema.
Reason: catches migration and persistence issues early in an offline-first app.

4. `Backend auth/RLS contract tests`.
Reason: prevents data-leak/security regressions as backend is introduced.

5. `Maestro` for MVP end-to-end flows.
Reason: practical mobile E2E coverage with lower setup cost than heavier alternatives.

6. `Quality gate in CI` (core tests must pass before merge).
Reason: keeps AI-generated changes safe and predictable as code volume grows.

## Default testing practice

- Every feature should include at least one success-path test and one offline/error-path test.

## Planned next phase (UI quality and appearance)

1. Add visual regression testing for critical screens/components.
Reason: catch layout and styling regressions (spacing, clipping, overlap) that behavior tests miss.

2. Define a lightweight UI contract per key screen (visibility, tap targets, no overlap, small-phone fit).
Reason: make visual correctness explicit so both humans and AI can validate against clear rules.

3. Add screenshot checkpoints in end-to-end flows.
Reason: verify real user journeys preserve expected appearance.

4. Establish baseline update policy for snapshots.
Reason: ensure visual changes are intentional and reviewed, not silently accepted.

5. Use visual diff output as AI iteration input.
Reason: helps AI make targeted UI fixes and faster design refinements.

## Decision log

- Date: 2026-02-13
- Decision: Use Vitest, RN Testing Library/jest-expo, SQLite integration tests, backend contract tests, and Maestro smoke E2E.
- Reason: Balances confidence and speed for an offline-first mobile MVP.
- Impact: Provides coverage where regressions are most likely without slowing early delivery.
