## Milestone objective

Decide and lock the backend platform for MVP, stand up a minimal backend that runs locally, define a deployment strategy from free tier to paid scale, implement secure user authentication/authorization, and expose authenticated sync APIs for `gyms`, `sessions`, `session_exercises`, and `exercise_sets`.

## In scope

- Evaluate backend stack options against explicit criteria:
  - ease of development and onboarding
  - free-tier practicality
  - ability to operate at zero spend initially, or with strict predefined spend limits when paid usage is enabled
  - no dependency on uncapped credit-card-backed auto-spend for baseline operation
  - migration path to stronger paid offering
  - security/auth and authorization primitives
  - local development quality
- Confirm or revise the currently planned backend platform and record rationale in architecture docs.
- Implement minimal backend runtime that can:
  - start locally with one documented command path
  - run schema migrations
  - expose a health endpoint
- Rationalize local testing checklists into a standard fast quality-gate command path (or equivalent wrapper) for repeatable end-of-task verification.
- Define and codify backend testing strategy updates required by introducing `Supabase`:
  - backend test layers and ownership (`DB`, `Edge`, `Supabase-local integration`, hosted smoke, cross-stack `E2E`)
  - local-first execution expectations and manual verification posture while CI is absent
  - project structure/testing conventions that follow-on tasks and agents must use
- Define deployment strategy and environment model (`local`, `preview/staging`, `production`) including secrets handling and rollback expectations.
- Define user concept and access model:
  - user identity
  - authentication flow(s)
  - mechanism to add users in this stage (for example: controlled invite list or admin provisioning flow)
  - authorization ownership rules
  - baseline hardening controls
- Implement backend API contract for sync domain entities:
  - create/read/update for app-owned state
  - ownership enforcement for every record operation
  - API contract documentation for FE integration later

## Out of scope

- FE screen integration for auth or sync.
- Offline outbox engine and client-side conflict resolution orchestration.
- Group/social features and leaderboard logic.
- Advanced analytics/reporting.
- Full implementation of cross-stack mobile+backend `E2E` tests (strategy/documentation only in M5).
- Mobile test-directory refactor (for example moving `apps/mobile/app/__tests__`) unless scoped by a dedicated follow-up task.

## Deliverables

1. Backend platform decision record with considered options and final recommendation.
2. Minimal backend project scaffold and local runbook.
3. Deployment strategy/runbook from free tier to paid scale path.
4. Secure auth/authz baseline implemented and verified.
5. Sync API endpoints for session-tracking entities with ownership checks.
6. Backend contract test suite covering auth, authz, and API behavior.
7. Updated AI/testing/task-template guidance capturing backend project structure and testing expectations.
8. Standard local quality-gate command path/checklist for fast repeatable verification (with current no-CI posture documented).

## Acceptance criteria

1. A backend decision record exists documenting considered options, selected stack, rationale, and key tradeoffs.
2. `docs/specs/03-technical-architecture.md` is updated to reflect the selected backend stack and its rationale.
3. Backend can run locally from a clean checkout using documented commands, apply migrations, and return healthy status from a health endpoint.
4. Deployment strategy defines environment separation, secrets handling, backup/restore expectations, and an upgrade path from free tier to paid offering.
5. Stack and deployment choices document explicit spend controls (zero-spend mode or predefined hard spend limit) and avoid uncapped spending exposure.
6. Authentication works for MVP-required flows and issues verifiable identity for API access.
7. A user provisioning mechanism exists for this stage so new users can be added without FE integration.
8. Authorization prevents cross-user data access for all sync entities; negative tests prove unauthorized access is rejected.
9. API supports authenticated read/write operations for `gyms`, `sessions`, `session_exercises`, and `exercise_sets`.
10. FE integration is explicitly deferred, but API contract documentation is sufficient for a later integration task.
11. Backend quality gates and contract tests defined by the milestone task cards pass before milestone closeout.
12. `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`, `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md`, and task template(s) are updated to reflect backend testing layers, manual verification posture (no CI yet), and project-structure conventions.
13. A standard local quality-gate command path (or documented wrapper set) is defined for fast checks, with clear scope and limits (what it covers vs what remains manual/task-specific).

## Backend platform decision (from `T-20260220-07`)

- Date locked: `2026-02-23`
- Primary stack for MVP/M5 execution: `Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS)` with local Supabase stack for high-fidelity local development/testing.
- Documented fallback (contingency only): `Cloudflare Workers + D1`, requiring a separate auth/authz primitive selection and more app-layer ownership enforcement work.
- Why `Supabase` won for M5:
  - fastest path to secure auth/authz + SQL-backed sync API baseline in one milestone,
  - better SQL/data portability for future provider moves,
  - stronger local-test fidelity for auth/data policy work, which aligns with the project’s local-first verification bias.
- Spend-control posture:
  - default `zero spend` on free tier,
  - no paid enablement without explicit task-level approval and written guardrails,
  - if paid path is enabled later, define thresholds + alerts/caps + downgrade actions first.
- Implementation assumptions (carry into remaining M5 tasks):
  - provider choice is locked unless a blocking issue is found,
  - sync API contract remains provider-neutral,
  - ownership enforcement must be backend-enforced (not FE-only).
- Full comparison and rationale: `docs/tasks/T-20260220-07-m5-backend-stack-decision-and-architecture-update.md`

## Deferred follow-up tasks (not required for M5 closeout)

1. `docs/tasks/T-20260225-13-post-m5-mobile-test-directory-refactor.md` - move mobile tests out of `apps/mobile/app/__tests__` and rationalize test asset layout without behavior changes. (`planned`)

## Risks / dependencies

- Stack decision task is a strict dependency for implementation tasks; provider choice is locked to `Supabase` unless a documented contingency trigger is hit.
- `Supabase` local stack/runtime friction (CLI, Docker/runtime compatibility, local auth/function behavior) could still trigger contingency escalation even though provider selection is locked.
- Auth model and authorization policies must be settled before API endpoint implementation to avoid rework.
- If free-tier constraints are too tight for MVP data volume, deployment strategy must include explicit paid-tier trigger thresholds.
- API contract drift risk exists unless schema and endpoint contracts are versioned and tested together.
- Repo-structure cleanup churn risk: moving existing mobile tests during M5 backend setup could distract from backend delivery; keep refactor isolated in a dedicated follow-up task.

## Decision log

- Date: 2026-02-20
- Decision: Plan M5 to combine backend foundation + secure auth + backend-side sync API contract in one milestone while keeping FE integration out of scope.
- Reason: This creates a complete backend-ready surface for the next FE integration milestone without mixing FE concerns into platform/security setup.
- Impact: M5 completion should enable a focused FE integration milestone with lower platform uncertainty.

- Date: 2026-02-23
- Decision: Lock M5 primary backend stack to `Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS)` and document `Cloudflare Workers + D1` as contingency fallback.
- Reason: `Supabase` best satisfies the combined M5 constraints of local runtime requirement, auth/authz delivery speed, SQL/data portability, and high-fidelity local testing.
- Impact: Remaining M5 tasks can proceed without reopening provider selection; fallback only activates if a concrete blocking issue is found during implementation.

- Date: 2026-02-25
- Decision: M5 auth/authz baseline uses `email + password` sign-in for admin-provisioned users only, direct `owner_user_id -> auth.users(id)` linkage, and table-level `RLS` with redundant ownership columns on all sync-domain tables.
- Reason: Fastest path to secure ownership enforcement and local-fidelity auth/RLS testing while deferring profile-table and FE-auth complexity.
- Impact: `T-20260220-11` can implement sync APIs against pre-secured user-owned tables in `app_public` without reopening the ownership model.

## Completion note

- What changed:
  - `T-20260220-08` completed: added `supabase/` local runtime scaffold (migration + deterministic seed + health Edge Function), backend-local smoke wrappers/tests, and backend runbook/env examples.
  - Updated project/testing/process docs and templates for Supabase backend local verification conventions, hosted-smoke ownership documentation, and `supabase/` project structure placement.
  - `T-20260220-10` completed: added `Supabase Auth` + `RLS` security baseline for user-owned sync tables in `app_public`, controlled user provisioning scripts, and local auth/authz contract tests (including auth failure, unauth denial, and cross-user denial coverage).
  - `T-20260220-11` completed: selected `PostgREST` table routes on `app_public` as the M5 sync API baseline surface, documented provider-neutral sync method contracts + Supabase route mappings in `supabase/session-sync-api-contract.md`, and added local sync API contract tests covering success/validation/unauth/cross-user denial paths for all sync-domain entities.
  - `T-20260225-12` completed: added repo-level standard local quality-gate wrappers (`./scripts/quality-fast.sh`, `./scripts/quality-slow.sh`), documented the fast/slow gate model and trigger rules, updated the task-card template to reduce repeated verify checklists, and documented repo-root `scripts/` as the canonical location for cross-workspace quality-gate wrappers.
- Verification summary:
  - Local Supabase runtime started successfully (port-offset config `554xx` used to avoid a host collision on default `54322`).
  - `supabase db reset` (via wrapper) reapplied the baseline migration and deterministic seed.
  - Health endpoint and seed fixture smokes passed against the local Supabase API surface.
  - Combined backend-local fast smoke suite passed (`./supabase/scripts/test-fast.sh`).
  - Auth/authz local contract suite passed (`./supabase/scripts/test-auth-authz.sh`) including password auth success/failure, self-signup disabled checks, unauthenticated denial, and cross-user `RLS`/constraint denial paths.
  - Sync API local contract suite passed (`./supabase/scripts/test-sync-api-contract.sh`) including authenticated create/read/update/list flows plus validation and ownership-denial coverage for `gyms`, `sessions`, `session_exercises`, and `exercise_sets`.
  - `./scripts/quality-fast.sh frontend` executed and correctly dispatched frontend fast gates; run stopped on pre-existing mobile route-typing `typecheck` errors (wrapper implementation itself verified).
  - Direct frontend parity spot-check passed (`cd apps/mobile && npm run lint`).
- What remains:
  - Milestone status remains `in_progress`; task `T-20260220-09` (deployment strategy/environments) is still pending.
