## Milestone objective

Integrate the mobile app with the existing local/backend sync foundation for the current session-tracking domain so authenticated users can sync opportunistically without breaking the app's local-first behavior, while documenting conflict policy, sync status behavior, and verification expectations in the project-level docs.

## In scope

- Define and document the M11 sync behavior contract:
  - auth-gated sync behavior
  - sync triggers and cadence
  - graceful offline/backend-unavailable behavior
  - conflict resolution policy
  - sync status and diagnostics semantics
- Scope sync to the current M5-backed session domain:
  - `gyms`
  - `sessions`
  - `session_exercises`
  - `exercise_sets`
- Audit the current backend sync contract against real frontend edit behavior and add parity support where needed:
  - delete/tombstone semantics or equivalent graph-parity mechanism
  - child-row parity for nested session edits
- Add a mobile auth/session adapter for sync consumption:
  - sync only runs when an authenticated user session is available
  - no end-user login UI in this milestone
- Add mobile sync state persistence:
  - last successful sync time
  - last failed sync time
  - last attempted sync time
  - current sync status / reason for pause
- Implement the sync engine/orchestrator for foreground app usage:
  - bootstrap/app-open
  - app foreground/resume
  - connectivity regain
  - periodic polling while app is open
- Add a simple sync status surface in the app:
  - new `settings` or `profile` route
  - optional lightweight stale/failure indicator if sync has been failing for an extended period
- Add test coverage across mock-backend and real local-backend lanes.
- Update project-level docs (`03`, `04`, `06`) whenever stable sync behavior, architecture, or verification rules are introduced.

## Out of scope

- End-user login/sign-up/forgot-password/logout UI.
- Public self-signup or account-management flows.
- Cloud deployment/staging/production environment strategy.
- OS-level background fetch or native background sync scheduling.
- Hard multi-device enforcement, remote device management, or explicit device-switch UX.
- Sync for frontend data not yet represented by backend APIs (for example exercise-catalog metadata) unless a dedicated follow-up task expands backend scope first.

## Locked sync contract (Task 01)

- Auth gating:
  - sync remains paused when no authenticated session exists or when auth expires;
  - local recording, autosave, and history behavior continue without backend access.
- Trigger model:
  - first sync attempt occurs opportunistically on app bootstrap/open when an authenticated session exists;
  - additional attempts occur on app foreground/resume, connectivity regain, and periodic polling while the app remains open;
  - M11 does not guarantee OS-level background delivery.
- Scope boundary:
  - only the current M5-backed session domain is syncable in M11: `gyms`, `sessions`, `session_exercises`, and `exercise_sets`;
  - exercise-catalog metadata and other post-M5 frontend-only entities remain local-only.
- Conflict policy:
  - treat a session and its nested exercises/sets as one sync aggregate for correctness purposes;
  - do not treat independent child-row last-write wins as sufficient for recorder edits, because the current mobile save path rewrites the nested graph as a whole;
  - if both sides diverge, implementation must prefer an explicit stale-write/conflict path or another deterministic aggregate-level reconciliation rule rather than silently mixing child rows from different versions.
- Known backend parity gaps entering implementation:
  - `sessions.deleted_at` exists, but `session_exercises` and `exercise_sets` have no delete/tombstone representation in the M5 contract;
  - the current M5 `PostgREST` baseline only exposes row-level `GET/POST/PATCH`, which does not yet encode full session-graph replacement or nested child removal parity.
- Implemented parity surface (`T-20260302-02`):
  - backend aggregate writes use `app_public.replace_session_graph`, exposed through `POST /rest/v1/rpc/replace_session_graph`;
  - the RPC compares `p_expected_updated_at` to the current remote `sessions.updated_at` value and rejects stale writes instead of mixing divergent child rows;
  - nested child omission in `p_exercises` is treated as deletion during replacement, so session-exercise and set parity is preserved without adding child tombstones.
- Implemented mobile sync foundation (`T-20260302-03`):
  - the app root now provides a default logged-out sync auth-session source so later tasks can inject real auth state without coupling sync code to login UI;
  - mobile sync backend wiring reads public Supabase config from `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and only attaches `Authorization` when a valid auth session is present;
  - local sync metadata now persists in SQLite `sync_state`, with an explicit `never_initialized` default status before sync orchestration begins updating it.
- Implemented foreground sync engine (`T-20260302-04`):
  - the app root now mounts a foreground-only sync engine boundary that evaluates sync on bootstrap/open, app foreground/resume, connectivity regain, and periodic polling while the app remains active;
  - the engine pauses quietly with persisted reasons when auth is missing/expired, the backend is unconfigured, or the device is offline, and uses exponential backoff for backend-unavailable failures without blocking local usage;
  - each sync attempt reconciles the current M11 domain (`gyms` plus full session graphs) by comparing local and remote aggregate `updatedAt` values, treating the newer aggregate as authoritative;
  - session graph pushes use `replace_session_graph`, and `SESSION_GRAPH_STALE` falls back to a remote re-read before either pulling the fresher remote aggregate or retrying one more compare-and-swap push with the newer remote version.
- Implemented sync diagnostics UI (`T-20260302-05`):
  - the app now exposes a dedicated `/sync-status` route that reads persisted `sync_state` metadata and shows current status, pause reason, and recent attempt/success/failure timestamps;
  - the shared bottom navigation now includes a compact sync-status shortcut so degraded sync is discoverable without becoming a blocking banner or modal;
  - routine paused states such as offline or auth-missing use calm informational copy, while backend-unavailable retry states use a warning tone without changing local-recording behavior.

## Deliverables

1. M11 sync behavior contract documented across milestone docs and promoted to project-level architecture/testing/process docs where behavior becomes stable.
2. Backend sync contract parity for the current mobile session-graph editing model.
3. Mobile auth-aware backend client and sync state persistence foundation.
4. Foreground sync engine/orchestrator with retry/recovery behavior that preserves local-first UX.
5. A small in-app sync status/settings surface.
6. Mock-backend sync scenario coverage for the major sync paths and failure modes.
7. First `Maestro` + local `Supabase` cross-stack sync `E2E` proof path.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Sync remains disabled when no authenticated session exists, while local app usage continues normally.
2. When an authenticated session exists and connectivity/backend reachability allow it, the app syncs the scoped session domain without requiring manual user intervention.
3. The initial sync trigger model is implemented and documented:
  - bootstrap/app-open
  - app foreground/resume
  - connectivity regain
  - periodic polling while the app is open
4. The app persists and exposes at least:
  - `lastSuccessfulSyncAt`
  - `lastFailedSyncAt`
  - `lastAttemptedSyncAt`
  - current sync status / paused reason
5. Conflict resolution policy is explicitly documented and implemented for the scoped domain, with tests covering the relevant rare-conflict path or conflict-avoidance model.
  - session graphs are reconciled as aggregates, not as unrelated child-row winners.
6. Backend contract supports the frontend's real edit model for the scoped domain, including delete/tombstone or equivalent parity where needed.
  - nested exercise/set removals caused by full graph rewrites are preserved correctly.
7. Backend-unavailable, offline, and auth-missing/expired states are handled gracefully without crashing the app or surfacing noisy errors during normal use.
8. A new settings/profile-style route exposes sync status and last successful sync information.
9. Mock-backend tests cover the relevant scenario matrix:
  - frontend/local ahead
  - backend ahead
  - offline/backend unavailable recovery
  - auth-gated sync disabled path
  - conflict path or conflict-avoidance semantics
  - delete/tombstone parity when supported by the chosen contract
10. At least one real `Maestro` + local `Supabase` `E2E` path proves that local mobile changes reach the backend.
11. `docs/specs/03-technical-architecture.md`, `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`, and `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md` are kept current as stable sync behavior, architecture boundaries, and verification expectations are introduced or changed.
12. Relevant UI docs under `docs/specs/ui/**` are updated in the same session as the sync status route and any related navigation changes.

## Risks / dependencies

- The current M5 API baseline may be insufficient for full session-graph parity if nested deletes/tombstones are not represented.
- The mobile app currently has no auth UI and no shared provider layer; M11 must add sync-facing auth/session plumbing without overreaching into account UX.
- Exercise catalog and other post-M5 local-only data remain outside backend scope; attempting to sync them in M11 would widen the milestone substantially.
- Row-level last-write semantics may be too weak for real session-graph edits unless the aggregate reconciliation model is documented and implemented carefully.
- `Maestro` + local `Supabase` orchestration introduces cross-runtime complexity and should be isolated behind a repeatable wrapper/path.

## Decision log

- Date: `2026-03-02`
- Decision: M11 sync is auth-gated, but auth is not required for local app usage.
- Reason: Preserves local-first behavior while enabling cloud sync only when a valid authenticated session exists.
- Impact: Mobile sync code must distinguish `local-only` from `sync-enabled` states without blocking recording flows.

- Date: `2026-03-02`
- Decision: End-user login UI is out of scope for M11; sync consumes auth state via an adapter/test harness instead.
- Reason: Sync integration and login UX are separate concerns, and M11 should focus on correctness of sync behavior against the existing backend baseline.
- Impact: Tests and harnesses may inject or provision authenticated sessions without requiring production-style sign-in screens.

- Date: `2026-03-02`
- Decision: Initial sync behavior is foreground/app-usage based, not OS-level background sync.
- Reason: Bootstrap/resume/connectivity-regain/polling behavior is sufficient for the first sync milestone and avoids premature native-background complexity.
- Impact: M11 must document that sync occurs opportunistically while the app is active rather than guaranteeing background delivery.

- Date: `2026-03-02`
- Decision: M11 sync scope is limited to the current M5-backed session domain.
- Reason: The existing backend baseline only covers `gyms`, `sessions`, `session_exercises`, and `exercise_sets`; expanding beyond that would mix backend scope expansion with sync-engine delivery.
- Impact: Other frontend data remains local-only until a separate backend-expansion milestone/task introduces the necessary APIs.

- Date: `2026-03-02`
- Decision: M11 conflict handling is aggregate-oriented for session graphs, not child-row last-write-wins.
- Reason: The recorder persists nested exercise/set edits by replacing the session child graph, so mixing independently "winning" child rows would not preserve real user intent.
- Impact: Implementation and tests must use a deterministic stale-write/conflict-avoidance rule that preserves full graph parity, and backend parity work must add a child-removal mechanism.

- Date: `2026-03-03`
- Decision: M11 backend session-graph parity uses a `PostgREST RPC` (`replace_session_graph`) with compare-and-swap semantics on `sessions.updated_at`.
- Reason: Row-level child CRUD alone could not encode whole-graph replacement or omitted-child deletion without silently merging divergent child rows.
- Impact: Mobile sync write paths should use the aggregate RPC for session-graph pushes, while row-level `GET` routes remain valid for pulls and simpler entity reads.

- Date: `2026-03-03`
- Decision: The mobile sync foundation defaults to a logged-out auth source and persisted `sync_state` row with an explicit `never_initialized` status until a real authenticated session is injected.
- Reason: M11 needs a stable sync-facing auth/state contract before orchestration lands, but login UI remains out of scope for this milestone.
- Impact: Later sync tasks can consume one auth/config/state boundary instead of duplicating session gating logic, and simulator/runtime verification must include the SQLite migration path for `sync_state`.

- Date: `2026-03-03`
- Decision: The first M11 sync engine uses full-snapshot foreground reconciliation plus deterministic aggregate `updatedAt` winner rules instead of a persisted outbox.
- Reason: The scoped M11 domain is still small enough for full reconciliation, and this keeps the first engine simpler while the backend aggregate RPC already protects nested session parity.
- Impact: Sync attempts compare local and remote domain snapshots on each eligible foreground run, session-graph divergence is resolved at the aggregate level, and any future outbox/background evolution must be a deliberate follow-up rather than assumed current behavior.

- Date: `2026-03-03`
- Decision: User-facing sync diagnostics remain read-only and calm: `/sync-status` is the detailed surface, and `session-list` exposes only a lightweight entry/indicator card.
- Reason: M11 needs discoverable sync health information without making routine offline or auth-paused periods feel like blockers.
- Impact: UI copy distinguishes paused/waiting from delayed states, and future sync controls or account-management actions remain separate follow-up work.
