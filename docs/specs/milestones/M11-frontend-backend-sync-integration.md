## Milestone objective

Integrate the mobile app with the existing local/backend sync foundation for the current session-tracking domain so authenticated users can sync opportunistically without breaking the app's local-first behavior, while documenting conflict policy, sync status behavior, and verification expectations in the project-level docs.

## In scope

- Define and document the M11 sync behavior contract:
  - auth-gated sync behavior
  - sync triggers and cadence
  - graceful offline/backend-unavailable behavior
  - conflict resolution policy
  - sync status and diagnostics semantics
- Scope sync to the current M5-backed session domain:
  - `gyms`
  - `sessions`
  - `session_exercises`
  - `exercise_sets`
- Audit the current backend sync contract against real frontend edit behavior and add parity support where needed:
  - delete/tombstone semantics or equivalent graph-parity mechanism
  - child-row parity for nested session edits
- Add a mobile auth/session adapter for sync consumption:
  - sync only runs when an authenticated user session is available
  - no end-user login UI in this milestone
- Add mobile sync state persistence:
  - last successful sync time
  - last failed sync time
  - last attempted sync time
  - current sync status / reason for pause
- Implement the sync engine/orchestrator for foreground app usage:
  - bootstrap/app-open
  - app foreground/resume
  - connectivity regain
  - periodic polling while app is open
- Add a simple sync status surface in the app:
  - new `settings` or `profile` route
  - optional lightweight stale/failure indicator if sync has been failing for an extended period
- Add test coverage across mock-backend and real local-backend lanes.
- Update project-level docs (`03`, `04`, `06`) whenever stable sync behavior, architecture, or verification rules are introduced.

## Out of scope

- End-user login/sign-up/forgot-password/logout UI.
- Public self-signup or account-management flows.
- Cloud deployment/staging/production environment strategy.
- OS-level background fetch or native background sync scheduling.
- Hard multi-device enforcement, remote device management, or explicit device-switch UX.
- Sync for frontend data not yet represented by backend APIs (for example exercise-catalog metadata) unless a dedicated follow-up task expands backend scope first.

## Deliverables

1. M11 sync behavior contract documented across milestone docs and promoted to project-level architecture/testing/process docs where behavior becomes stable.
2. Backend sync contract parity for the current mobile session-graph editing model.
3. Mobile auth-aware backend client and sync state persistence foundation.
4. Foreground sync engine/orchestrator with retry/recovery behavior that preserves local-first UX.
5. A small in-app sync status/settings surface.
6. Mock-backend sync scenario coverage for the major sync paths and failure modes.
7. First `Maestro` + local `Supabase` cross-stack sync `E2E` proof path.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Sync remains disabled when no authenticated session exists, while local app usage continues normally.
2. When an authenticated session exists and connectivity/backend reachability allow it, the app syncs the scoped session domain without requiring manual user intervention.
3. The initial sync trigger model is implemented and documented:
  - bootstrap/app-open
  - app foreground/resume
  - connectivity regain
  - periodic polling while the app is open
4. The app persists and exposes at least:
  - `lastSuccessfulSyncAt`
  - `lastFailedSyncAt`
  - `lastAttemptedSyncAt`
  - current sync status / paused reason
5. Conflict resolution policy is explicitly documented and implemented for the scoped domain, with tests covering the relevant rare-conflict path or conflict-avoidance model.
6. Backend contract supports the frontend's real edit model for the scoped domain, including delete/tombstone or equivalent parity where needed.
7. Backend-unavailable, offline, and auth-missing/expired states are handled gracefully without crashing the app or surfacing noisy errors during normal use.
8. A new settings/profile-style route exposes sync status and last successful sync information.
9. Mock-backend tests cover the relevant scenario matrix:
  - frontend/local ahead
  - backend ahead
  - offline/backend unavailable recovery
  - auth-gated sync disabled path
  - conflict path or conflict-avoidance semantics
  - delete/tombstone parity when supported by the chosen contract
10. At least one real `Maestro` + local `Supabase` `E2E` path proves that local mobile changes reach the backend.
11. `docs/specs/03-technical-architecture.md`, `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`, and `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md` are kept current as stable sync behavior, architecture boundaries, and verification expectations are introduced or changed.
12. Relevant UI docs under `docs/specs/ui/**` are updated in the same session as the sync status route and any related navigation changes.

## Task breakdown

6. `docs/tasks/T-20260302-06-m11-sync-mock-backend-scenarios-and-regression-coverage.md` - add mock-backend sync scenario coverage and regressions. (`planned`)
7. `docs/tasks/T-20260302-07-m11-maestro-local-backend-sync-e2e-smoke.md` - add the first local-Supabase cross-stack sync `E2E` smoke. (`planned`)

## Risks / dependencies

- The current M5 API baseline may be insufficient for full session-graph parity if nested deletes/tombstones are not represented.
- The mobile app currently has no auth UI and no shared provider layer; M11 must add sync-facing auth/session plumbing without overreaching into account UX.
- Exercise catalog and other post-M5 local-only data remain outside backend scope; attempting to sync them in M11 would widen the milestone substantially.
- Row-level last-write semantics may be too weak for real session-graph edits unless the aggregate reconciliation model is documented and implemented carefully.
- `Maestro` + local `Supabase` orchestration introduces cross-runtime complexity and should be isolated behind a repeatable wrapper/path.

## Decision log

- Date: `2026-03-02`
- Decision: M11 sync is auth-gated, but auth is not required for local app usage.
- Reason: Preserves local-first behavior while enabling cloud sync only when a valid authenticated session exists.
- Impact: Mobile sync code must distinguish `local-only` from `sync-enabled` states without blocking recording flows.

- Date: `2026-03-02`
- Decision: End-user login UI is out of scope for M11; sync consumes auth state via an adapter/test harness instead.
- Reason: Sync integration and login UX are separate concerns, and M11 should focus on correctness of sync behavior against the existing backend baseline.
- Impact: Tests and harnesses may inject or provision authenticated sessions without requiring production-style sign-in screens.

- Date: `2026-03-02`
- Decision: Initial sync behavior is foreground/app-usage based, not OS-level background sync.
- Reason: Bootstrap/resume/connectivity-regain/polling behavior is sufficient for the first sync milestone and avoids premature native-background complexity.
- Impact: M11 must document that sync occurs opportunistically while the app is active rather than guaranteeing background delivery.

- Date: `2026-03-02`
- Decision: M11 sync scope is limited to the current M5-backed session domain.
- Reason: The existing backend baseline only covers `gyms`, `sessions`, `session_exercises`, and `exercise_sets`; expanding beyond that would mix backend scope expansion with sync-engine delivery.
- Impact: Other frontend data remains local-only until a separate backend-expansion milestone/task introduces the necessary APIs.

## Status update checklist (mandatory during task closeout)

- Keep milestone `Status` current as tasks progress.
- Update task breakdown entries to reflect each task state (`planned | in_progress | completed | blocked | outdated`).
- If milestone remains open after a session, record why in the active task completion note and/or milestone completion note (status remains `in_progress`).
