# Data Model (Authoritative)

## Purpose

Define the canonical data model boundaries for local mobile storage, backend persistence, ownership, and sync scope.

This document is project-level source of truth for what data exists and how it is expected to move.

## Relationship to other specs

- Architecture/runtime behavior lives in `docs/specs/03-technical-architecture.md`.
- Testing requirements live in `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md`.
- Milestone/task docs may add detail but must not override this document.

## Current model layers

1. Mobile local data layer (`SQLite` via Drizzle)
- primary runtime store for app behavior.
- includes user-owned domain data plus static seeded taxonomy data.

2. Backend auth/profile layer (`Supabase Auth` + `app_public.user_profiles`)
- auth identity and account profile management.
- not the same as generic sync-domain backup.

3. Backend sync/projection layer (M13 planned)
- event ingest + projection for user-domain backup/restore.

## Local schema inventory (current)

### User-owned domain data (sync/backups expected)

- `gyms`
- `sessions`
- `session_exercises`
- `exercise_sets`
- `exercise_definitions`
- `exercise_muscle_mappings`
- `exercise_tag_definitions`
- `session_exercise_tags`

### Static/system data (not user backup scope)

- `muscle_groups` (seeded, non-editable taxonomy)

### Test/runtime-only data (not user backup scope)

- `smoke_records`

## Backend schema inventory (current)

### Auth/profile

- `auth.users` (identity)
- `app_public.user_profiles` (username profile data, `1:1` with `auth.users(id)`)

### Sync-domain tables from M5 baseline

- `app_public.gyms`
- `app_public.sessions`
- `app_public.session_exercises`
- `app_public.exercise_sets`

Note:
- M5 sync-domain coverage is a partial subset of current local user-owned domain entities.
- M13 expands backup expectations to all user-owned local domain entities through event ingest + projection.

## Ownership and identity invariants

1. User-owned backend rows are auth-scoped and backend-enforced (`RLS`/constraints).
2. Mobile clients never use `service_role` credentials.
3. Sync transport must be idempotent for repeated delivery attempts.
4. Single-device assumptions are valid for M13; multi-device semantics are deferred.

## M13 sync data-model contract (planned)

1. Client emits granular outbox events for user-domain mutations.
2. Backend ingests events with idempotency (`event_id`) and per-device ordering (`sequence_in_device`).
3. Backend projects events into restorable user-state models.
4. Restore/bootstrap must be coherent across all user-owned entities listed in this document.

## Maintenance rule (mandatory)

Update this file in the same task/session when any of the following change:

- local schema entities or ownership classification,
- backend schema entities participating in user backup/sync,
- sync data-scope boundaries,
- identity/ownership invariants that affect data integrity.
