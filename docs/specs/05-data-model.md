# Data Model (Authoritative)

## Purpose

Define the canonical data model boundaries for local mobile storage, backend persistence, ownership, and sync scope.

This document is project-level source of truth for what data exists and how it is expected to move.

## Relationship to other specs

- Architecture/runtime behavior lives in `docs/specs/03-technical-architecture.md`.
- Testing requirements live in `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md`.
- Milestone/task docs may add detail but must not override this document.

## Current model layers

1. Mobile local data layer (`SQLite` via Drizzle)
- primary runtime store for app behavior.
- includes user-owned domain data plus static seeded taxonomy data.

2. Backend auth/profile layer (`Supabase Auth` + `app_public.user_profiles`)
- auth identity and account profile management.
- not the same as generic sync-domain backup.

3. Backend sync/projection layer (M13 implemented baseline)
- event ingest + projection for user-domain backup/restore.

## Local schema inventory (current)

### User-owned domain data (sync/backups expected)

- `gyms`
- `sessions`
- `session_exercises`
- `exercise_sets`
- `exercise_definitions`
- `exercise_muscle_mappings`
- `exercise_tag_definitions`
- `session_exercise_tags`

### Static/system data (not user backup scope)

- `muscle_groups` (seeded, non-editable taxonomy)

### Test/runtime-only data (not user backup scope)

- `smoke_records`

## Backend schema inventory (current)

### Auth/profile

- `auth.users` (identity)
- `app_public.user_profiles` (username profile data, `1:1` with `auth.users(id)`)

### Sync-domain projection tables (M13 backend baseline)

- `app_public.gyms` (`deleted_at` projection support)
- `app_public.sessions`
- `app_public.session_exercises` (`exercise_definition_id` + `deleted_at` projection support)
- `app_public.exercise_sets` (`deleted_at` projection support)
- `app_public.exercise_definitions`
- `app_public.exercise_muscle_mappings`
- `app_public.exercise_tag_definitions`
- `app_public.session_exercise_tags`

### Ingest metadata tables (M13 backend baseline)

- `app_public.sync_device_ingest_state`
- `app_public.sync_ingested_events`

## Ownership and identity invariants

1. User-owned backend rows are auth-scoped and backend-enforced (`RLS`/constraints).
2. Mobile clients never use `service_role` credentials.
3. Sync transport must be idempotent for repeated delivery attempts.
4. Single-device assumptions are valid for M13; multi-device semantics are deferred.

## M13 sync data-model contract (implemented baseline)

1. Client emits granular outbox events for user-domain mutations.
2. Backend ingests events with idempotency key `(owner_user_id, device_id, event_id)` and strict per-device ordering via `sequence_in_device`.
3. Backend projects applied events into restorable user-state models.
4. Restore/bootstrap must be coherent across all user-owned entities listed in this document.

### Canonical event envelope invariants

- Request-level required fields:
  - `device_id`
  - `batch_id`
  - `sent_at_ms`
  - `events` (`1..100`)
- Event-level required fields:
  - `event_id`
  - `sequence_in_device`
  - `occurred_at_ms`
  - `entity_type`
  - `entity_id`
  - `event_type`
  - `payload`
- Event-level optional fields:
  - `schema_version` (default `1`)
  - `trace_id`

### M13 entity-event coverage (locked; undelete is supported for all entities)

| Entity | Supported event types |
| --- | --- |
| `gyms` | `upsert`, `delete` (`upsert` handles undelete) |
| `sessions` | `upsert`, `delete`, `complete` (`upsert` handles undelete/reopen) |
| `session_exercises` | `upsert`, `delete`, `reorder` (`upsert` handles undelete) |
| `exercise_sets` | `upsert`, `delete`, `reorder` (`upsert` handles undelete) |
| `exercise_definitions` | `upsert`, `delete` (`upsert` handles undelete) |
| `exercise_muscle_mappings` | `attach`, `detach` (`attach` recreates detached edges) |
| `exercise_tag_definitions` | `upsert`, `delete` (`upsert` handles undelete) |
| `session_exercise_tags` | `attach`, `detach` (`attach` recreates detached edges) |

### M13 ingest/ack invariants (locked)

1. Backend processes batch events strictly in request order and stops on the first failing event.
2. Response contract is minimal:
   - `SUCCESS` for full-batch success.
   - `FAILURE` with `error_index`, `should_retry`, and free-text `message` (optional `error_event_id`).
3. Events before `error_index` are committed; the failed event and all later events are not applied.
4. Duplicate submit with same event body is a no-op success.
5. Reuse of `event_id` with a different event body fails with `should_retry=false`.

## Maintenance rule (mandatory)

Update this file in the same task/session when any of the following change:

- local schema entities or ownership classification,
- backend schema entities participating in user backup/sync,
- sync data-scope boundaries,
- identity/ownership invariants that affect data integrity.

Sync impact gate (mandatory for every data-model change):

- EVERY time a data model entity/relationship/ownership boundary is added or changed, sync impact MUST be explicitly addressed in the same task/session.
- The task must record one explicit decision:
  - `in sync scope` (with contract/mapping + implementation/test updates), or
  - `out of sync scope` (with explicit rationale and guardrails).
- Do not leave new/changed data-model elements with undefined sync behavior.
