## Objective

Implement backend event ingest and projection so outbox events are applied idempotently and restorable backup state stays coherent.

## Scope

### In scope

- Add authenticated ingest endpoint(s) for batched events.
- Enforce idempotency by `event_id` and ordering by `(device_id, sequence_in_device)`.
- Persist event ingest metadata/ack watermark.
- Project accepted events into restorable user-state tables/read models.
- Add backend contract tests for success, duplicate replay, ordering, and denial paths.

### Out of scope

- Frontend outbox emission logic.
- Profile UI work.
- End-to-end mobile Maestro verification.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Event ingest supports batch append with partial success/error detail.
2. Duplicate event replay is idempotent.
3. Out-of-order events are rejected or safely deferred per contract.
4. Projection state remains coherent for all M13 data-scope entities.
5. Backend auth/RLS denial paths are tested.
6. Backend fast/slow quality gates pass.

## Docs touched (required)

- `supabase/session-sync-api-contract.md` - ingest/ack/projection contract details.
- `docs/specs/05-data-model.md` - backend model updates for projection storage.
- `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md` - backend sync verification expectations.
- `docs/specs/milestones/M13-simple-backend-sync.md` - align technical approach details if needed.

## Testing and verification approach

- Planned checks/commands:
  - backend unit/contract tests for ingest/projection
  - `./scripts/quality-fast.sh backend`
  - `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend`
- Test layers covered:
  - db/constraint
  - contract/integration
  - local runtime smoke

## Implementation notes

- Planned files/areas allowed to change:
  - `supabase/migrations/**`
  - `supabase/functions/**` (if ingest endpoint uses functions)
  - `supabase/tests/**`
  - `supabase/scripts/**`
- Project structure impact:
  - no top-level structure change expected

## Mandatory verify gates

- Standard local fast gate: `./scripts/quality-fast.sh backend`
- Standard local slow gate: `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend`

## Evidence

- backend contract test outputs
- idempotency/replay proof summary
- projection correctness checks
