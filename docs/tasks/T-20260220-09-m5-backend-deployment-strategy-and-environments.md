## Objective

Define and document the backend deployment path from free tier to paid scale with explicit environment boundaries and operational safeguards.

## Scope

### In scope

- Define environment topology:
  - `local`
  - `preview/staging`
  - `production`
- Document deployment approach for selected stack/provider(s).
- Define cost/safety guardrails for hosting and managed services:
  - zero-spend default where possible
  - predefined spend limit/budget threshold when paid usage is enabled
  - avoid uncapped auto-spend exposure
- Define secrets management and rotation baseline.
- Define backup/restore and rollback expectations.
- Define scale-up triggers and migration plan from free tier to paid tier.
- Add deployment checklist suitable for repeatable release execution.

### Out of scope

- Full production infrastructure automation implementation.
- FE deployment or mobile release workflow changes.

## Acceptance criteria

1. A deployment strategy doc exists and maps each environment to purpose and controls.
2. Secrets handling, rotation expectations, and non-commit rules are explicitly documented.
3. Rollback and backup/restore expectations are documented and testable.
4. Free-tier limits, paid-upgrade trigger conditions, and spend guardrails are explicit.
5. Strategy documents how spending is constrained (zero-spend mode or predefined capped spend path) without relying on uncapped auto-spend.
6. The strategy is referenced by milestone docs and is usable by follow-up implementation tasks.

## Testing and verification approach

- Planned checks/commands:
  - documentation coherence review across architecture + milestone + deployment docs
  - command sanity check for any deployment helper script included in task scope
- Notes:
  - If automation/scripts are added, include dry-run evidence.

## Implementation notes

- Planned files/areas allowed to change:
  - `docs/specs/03-technical-architecture.md`
  - `docs/specs/milestones/M5-backend-foundation-authz-and-sync-api.md`
  - `docs/tasks/T-20260220-09-m5-backend-deployment-strategy-and-environments.md`
  - deployment/runbook docs under `docs/` (exact path to be chosen in-session)
- Constraints/assumptions:
  - Must align with selected stack/provider from `T-20260220-07`.
  - Keep MVP operations simple; avoid over-engineering.

## Mandatory verify gates

- `N/A (docs/planning task unless scripts are introduced)`

## Evidence

- Environment model summary.
- Free-tier-to-paid transition summary.
- Spend guardrail summary.
- Rollback and backup policy summary.

## Completion note
