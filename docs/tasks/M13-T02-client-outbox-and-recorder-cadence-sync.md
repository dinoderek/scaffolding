# Task Card

## Task metadata

- Task ID: `M13-T02-client-outbox-and-recorder-cadence-sync`
- Title: M13 client outbox and dual-cadence scheduler
- Status: `planned`
- File location rule:
  - author active cards in `docs/tasks/<task-id>.md`
  - move the file to `docs/tasks/complete/<task-id>.md` when `Status` becomes `completed` or `outdated`
- Session date: `2026-03-06`
- Session interaction mode: `interactive (default)`

## Parent references (required)

- Project directives: `docs/specs/README.md`
- Milestone spec: `docs/specs/milestones/M13-simple-backend-sync.md`
- Architecture: `docs/specs/03-technical-architecture.md`
- Data model: `docs/specs/05-data-model.md`
- AI development playbook: `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`
- Testing strategy: `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md`
- Project structure: `docs/specs/09-project-structure.md`

## Objective

Implement the local outbox and scheduler behavior with the locked cadence policy (`60s` general, `10s` on `session-recorder`).

## Scope

### In scope

- Add persistent outbox queue and delivery state.
- Emit events at domain write boundaries for M13 entity scope.
- Implement scheduler cadence switching by current route/context.
- Implement in-flight guard and backoff state machine.
- Add frontend unit/integration coverage for queue, cadence, retry, and offline resume.

### Out of scope

- Backend ingest endpoint implementation.
- First-sync bootstrap merge logic.
- Profile UI controls.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Events are queued for tracked entity mutations.
2. Scheduler uses `60s` cadence outside recorder and `10s` in recorder.
3. In-flight guard prevents concurrent sends.
4. Offline mode retains queue without data loss.
5. Backoff constants follow milestone policy.
6. Automated tests cover both cadence paths and retry behavior.

## Docs touched (required)

- `docs/specs/milestones/M13-simple-backend-sync.md` - implementation notes alignment if needed.
- `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md` - update only if stable coverage shape changes.

## Testing and verification approach

- Planned checks/commands:
  - focused outbox/scheduler Jest suites
  - `./scripts/quality-fast.sh frontend`
  - `./scripts/quality-slow.sh frontend` (required; recorder behavior is runtime-sensitive)
- Test layers covered:
  - unit
  - integration
  - runtime smoke

## Implementation notes

- Planned files/areas allowed to change:
  - `apps/mobile/src/**`
  - `apps/mobile/app/**` (only if route-context hooks are needed)
  - `apps/mobile/app/__tests__/**`
- Project structure impact:
  - none expected

## Mandatory verify gates

- Standard local fast gate: `./scripts/quality-fast.sh frontend`
- Standard local slow gate: `./scripts/quality-slow.sh frontend`

## Evidence

- targeted test command results
- fast/slow gate summaries
- recorder-vs-general cadence proof notes
