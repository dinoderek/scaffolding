## Objective

Implement deterministic automated proof that a brand-new app installation restored via sync produces identical user-domain state to the pre-sync state.

## Scope

### In scope

- Add a `Jest` test lane (primary) backed by local `Supabase` runtime baseline.
- Build a full M13 data-scope fixture by creating at least one row/edge for each entity:
  - `gyms`
  - `sessions`
  - `session_exercises`
  - `exercise_sets`
  - `exercise_definitions`
  - `exercise_muscle_mappings`
  - `exercise_tag_definitions`
  - `session_exercise_tags`
- Capture normalized deterministic pre-sync local snapshot.
- Run sync to successful convergence.
- Simulate reinstall (fresh local app data + fresh sync device state), re-login, trigger bootstrap/merge, and wait for convergence.
- Capture normalized post-restore snapshot and assert deep equality with pre-sync snapshot.
- Explicitly exclude non-scope state from comparison (auth credentials/session tokens, smoke/runtime-only artifacts, sync outbox/delivery metadata).

### Out of scope

- New sync protocol/schema changes.
- Multi-device semantics.
- Maestro as a required proof lane (optional supplemental evidence only).

## Acceptance criteria

1. A targeted automated test exists for reinstall restore-state parity.
2. The test creates/ensures at least one pre-sync record/edge for every M13 data-scope entity (including tags and tag assignments).
3. Pre-sync and post-restore snapshots are normalized deterministically before comparison.
4. Post-reinstall login + bootstrap/merge + convergence path is executed in the test and reaches success state.
5. Post-restore snapshot equals pre-sync snapshot for all M13 data-scope entities.
6. Non-scope state is excluded from parity assertions (auth/session credentials, runtime smoke data, sync outbox/delivery internals).
7. Primary lane uses `Jest` + local `Supabase` baseline (`Vitest` is not required).
8. `./scripts/quality-fast.sh frontend` passes.
9. `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend` passes (or explicit `N/A` rationale is documented if scope changes).

## Docs touched (required)

- `docs/specs/milestones/M13-simple-backend-sync.md` - track parity-proof implementation/closeout for M13 acceptance.
- `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md` - codify restore-parity verification expectations in M13 sync policy if needed.
- `docs/specs/tech/client-sync-engine.md` - document the reinstall restore-parity test lane and snapshot-comparison boundaries.

## Testing and verification approach

- Planned checks/commands:
  - `./supabase/scripts/ensure-local-runtime-baseline.sh`
  - targeted `Jest` restore-parity suite in `apps/mobile/app/__tests__/`
  - `./scripts/quality-fast.sh frontend`
  - `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend`
- Test layers covered:
  - integration
  - cross-stack integration (mobile runtime + local Supabase)
- Notes:
  - use `Jest` as the primary lane for deterministic state assertions;
  - Maestro evidence is optional and non-blocking for this task.

## Implementation notes

- Planned files/areas allowed to change:
  - `apps/mobile/app/__tests__/**`
  - `apps/mobile/src/sync/**`
  - `apps/mobile/src/data/**`
  - test helpers/harness code as needed
  - `docs/specs/**` and milestone/task docs
- Project structure impact:
  - none expected

## Mandatory verify gates

- Standard local fast gate: `./scripts/quality-fast.sh frontend`
- Standard local slow gate: `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend`
- Additional required runtime baseline command: `./supabase/scripts/ensure-local-runtime-baseline.sh`

## Evidence

- restore-parity test output showing pre-sync and post-restore snapshot equality
- command outputs for:
  - `./supabase/scripts/ensure-local-runtime-baseline.sh`
  - targeted `Jest` parity suite
  - `./scripts/quality-fast.sh frontend`
  - `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend`
- manual verification summary (if any)
