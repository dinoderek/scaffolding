- Title: M10 parallel iOS runtime toolkit and teardown
- Status: `planned`
- Session date: `2026-03-01`
- Session interaction mode: `interactive (default)`

## Parent references (required)

- Project directives: `docs/specs/README.md`
- Milestone spec: `docs/specs/milestones/M10-maestro-parallel-runtime-and-testing-conventions.md`
- Architecture: `docs/specs/03-technical-architecture.md`
- AI development playbook: `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`

- Project structure: `docs/specs/09-project-structure.md`
- Maestro runtime contract: `docs/specs/11-maestro-runtime-and-testing-conventions.md`

## Context Freshness (required at session start; update before edits)

- Verified current branch + HEAD commit: `TBD at execution start`
- Start-of-session sync completed per `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md` git sync workflow?: `TBD`
- Parent refs opened in this session:
  - `docs/specs/milestones/M10-maestro-parallel-runtime-and-testing-conventions.md`
  - `docs/specs/11-maestro-runtime-and-testing-conventions.md`
  - `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md`
  - `docs/specs/09-project-structure.md`
- Code/docs inventory freshness checks run:
  - `apps/mobile/scripts/ios-sim-boot.sh`
  - `apps/mobile/scripts/maestro-ios-slot-lock.sh`
  - `apps/mobile/scripts/maestro-ios-smoke.sh`
  - `apps/mobile/scripts/maestro-ios-data-smoke.sh`
- Known stale references or assumptions:
  - current runners duplicate most of their logic and still target Expo Go
- Optional helper command:
  - `./scripts/task-bootstrap.sh docs/tasks/T-20260301-03-m10-parallel-ios-runtime-toolkit-and-teardown.md`

## Objective

Implement the reusable runtime toolkit for M10 by separating provision, launch, and teardown responsibilities, persisting runtime state, and moving the current runners onto a development-client-based isolated runtime model that works across parallel worktrees.

## Scope

### In scope

- Refactor or replace the current runner scripts with a shared toolkit that covers:
  - simulator provisioning or deterministic resolution by configured identity,
  - simulator boot with retry/health handling,
  - development-client install/update,
  - Expo launch on an isolated port,
  - readiness checks before handing control to Maestro,
  - runtime state file emission,
  - teardown and cleanup after both success and partial failure.
- Decide whether the existing slot-lock script is retained, adapted, or replaced, while preserving cross-worktree safety.
- Write runtime logs and state artifacts that later scripts can consume instead of re-deriving process/device details.
- Keep or reintroduce the existing smoke/data-smoke command surface in `apps/mobile/package.json`, but have those commands run through the new toolkit.
- Remove duplicated logic between smoke and data-smoke runners where practical.

### Out of scope

- App-side harness route implementation.
- Deep-link setup taxonomy beyond the runtime handshake needed to load the bundle.
- Documentation-wide cleanup beyond the minimal contract updates needed for the toolkit to be understandable.

## UI Impact (required checkpoint)

- UI Impact?: `no`

## Acceptance criteria

1. The runtime toolkit has distinct provision, launch, and teardown responsibilities with clear inputs/outputs.
2. The toolkit no longer relies on Expo Go specific app IDs or Expo Go uninstall/reset behavior.
3. Runtime state artifacts exist and are sufficient to identify:
   - simulator/device used,
   - port used,
   - process ID(s) owned by the run,
   - artifact/log directory.
4. Teardown is safe after partial failure and does not leave stale slot/runtime ownership without a documented reason.
5. The current smoke/data-smoke entrypoints run through the shared toolkit rather than duplicated ad hoc boot/start logic.
6. A local frontend slow gate run validates the reworked runtime path on real iOS simulator execution. 

CRUCIAL: THE TESTS MUST RUN ON DEVELOPMENT BUILD NOW. NO EXPO GO ALLOWED.

## Docs touched (required)

- Planned docs/spec files to update and why:
  - `docs/specs/11-maestro-runtime-and-testing-conventions.md` - record finalized runtime toolkit contract and state/log outputs
  - `docs/specs/milestones/M10-maestro-parallel-runtime-and-testing-conventions.md` - update task progress and any runtime-contract clarifications discovered during implementation

## Testing and verification approach

- Planned checks/commands:
  - targeted toolkit script invocations for provision/launch/teardown behavior
  - `./scripts/quality-fast.sh frontend`
  - `./scripts/quality-slow.sh frontend`
- Standard local gate usage:
  - `./scripts/quality-fast.sh frontend` (required)
  - `./scripts/quality-slow.sh frontend` (required; runtime-tooling changes directly affect Maestro execution)
- Test layers covered:
  - script/runtime orchestration verification
  - frontend lint/typecheck/test fast gate
  - real iOS simulator Maestro smoke/data-smoke slow gate
- Execution triggers:
  - always for both fast and slow gates because runner/runtime behavior changes are the task itself
- Slow-gate triggers:
  - any change to Maestro runners, simulator helpers, slot locking, runtime state/cleanup, or Expo launch handshake
- Hosted/deployed smoke ownership: `N/A`
- CI/manual posture note: no CI configured; local runtime evidence is mandatory

## Implementation notes

- Planned files/areas allowed to change:
  - `apps/mobile/scripts/**`
  - `apps/mobile/package.json`
  - `apps/mobile/.maestro/**` only if runner contract changes require small flow metadata updates
  - `docs/specs/11-maestro-runtime-and-testing-conventions.md`
  - `docs/specs/milestones/M10-maestro-parallel-runtime-and-testing-conventions.md`
- Project structure impact:
  - no new top-level folders expected, but new canonical runtime-state or config paths may need later documentation in `docs/specs/09-project-structure.md`
- Constraints/assumptions:
  - preserve cross-worktree safety on one host
  - keep artifact directories task-aware and debuggable

## Mandatory verify gates

- Standard local fast gate: `./scripts/quality-fast.sh frontend`
- Standard local slow gate: `./scripts/quality-slow.sh frontend`
- Optional closeout helper: `./scripts/task-closeout-check.sh docs/tasks/T-20260301-03-m10-parallel-ios-runtime-toolkit-and-teardown.md`
- Additional gate(s), if any:
  - targeted provision/launch/teardown command evidence if the slow gate alone does not expose enough lifecycle detail

## Evidence

- Runtime toolkit surface summary.
- Runtime state/log artifact summary.
- Fast-gate and slow-gate result summary.
- Manual verification summary (CI absent), including any failure-recovery behavior exercised.

## Completion note (fill at end per `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`)

- What changed:
- What tests ran:
- What remains:

## Status update checklist (mandatory at closeout)

- Update `Status` to `completed` or `blocked`.
- Ensure completion note is filled before handoff.
- If significant project-structure changes were made, update `docs/specs/09-project-structure.md` and mention it in completion note.
- Update parent milestone task breakdown/status in the same session.
- Run `./scripts/task-closeout-check.sh docs/tasks/T-20260301-03-m10-parallel-ios-runtime-toolkit-and-teardown.md` (or document why `N/A`) before handoff.
