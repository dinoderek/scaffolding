## Objective

Introduce the first domain-local Drizzle schema and migrations for session recording entities with forward-compatible provenance metadata.

## Scope

### In scope

- Add Drizzle schema tables:
  - `gyms`
  - `sessions`
  - `session_exercises`
  - `exercise_sets`
- Model draft/completed session lifecycle fields (`status`, timing fields, duration materialization field).
- Add relational constraints and indexes for ordered exercise/set rows and cascade behavior.
- Keep gym names non-unique.
- Add provenance-ready columns for future server/group adoption:
  - gym origin fields (scope/source IDs)
  - exercise origin linkage fields (scope/source IDs)
- Generate migration artifacts and update runtime migration bundle.

### Out of scope

- Autosave orchestration behavior.
- Screen-level lifecycle hooks.
- Session completion business flow and submit UX.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Domain schema compiles and replaces smoke-table usage in exported schema index.
2. `Session -> Exercise -> Set` foreign-key relationships are enforced with deterministic ordering constraints.
3. `gyms.name` is not unique.
4. Provenance fields are present for gyms and session exercises, defaulting to local/private origin semantics.
5. Migration artifacts are generated and runtime migration config is updated in sync.
6. `npm run db:generate:canary`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run test` pass in `apps/mobile`.

## Testing and verification approach (follow `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`)

- Planned checks/commands:
  - `npm run db:generate:canary`
  - targeted schema/migration integration tests (if created in-task)
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run test`
- Notes:
  - Validate fresh-bootstrap migration path remains deterministic after schema replacement.

## Implementation notes

- Planned files/areas allowed to change:
  - `apps/mobile/src/data/schema/**`
  - `apps/mobile/src/data/migrations/**`
  - `apps/mobile/drizzle/**`
  - `apps/mobile/src/data/bootstrap.ts` (only as needed for schema import/runtime compatibility)
  - `apps/mobile/app/__tests__/**` (data-layer tests only)
- Constraints/assumptions:
  - Use UUID/text IDs for domain entities to avoid local-only integer identity coupling.
  - Preserve backward-safe migration semantics for already-initialized local DBs.

## Mandatory verify gates

- `npm run lint` (from `apps/mobile`)
- `npm run typecheck` (from `apps/mobile`)
- `npm run test` (from `apps/mobile`)
- `npm run db:generate:canary` (from `apps/mobile`)

## Evidence (follow `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`)

- Lane 1 command output summary.
- Migration artifact summary (`apps/mobile/drizzle/**` and runtime bundle changes).
