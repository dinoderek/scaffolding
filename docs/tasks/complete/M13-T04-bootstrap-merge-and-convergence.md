- Task ID: `M13-T04-bootstrap-merge-and-convergence`
- Title: M13 first-enable bootstrap, merge, and convergence
- Status: `completed`
- File location rule:
  - author active cards in `docs/tasks/<task-id>.md`
  - move the file to `docs/tasks/complete/<task-id>.md` when `Status` becomes `completed` or `outdated`

## Objective

Implement first-sync bootstrap and local merge flow, then converge outbox delivery for the merged result.

## Scope

### In scope

- Add one-time bootstrap trigger on sync enable.
- Fetch remote restorable state and merge with local state.
- Queue and flush post-merge local deltas/events.
- Apply post-merge batch response semantics correctly (`SUCCESS` clears batch; `FAILURE` retains suffix from `error_index`).
- Protect local-first behavior on failures.
- Add automated coverage for merge correctness and convergence outcomes.

### Out of scope

- Profile UI visuals/refinement.
- Backend ingest internals beyond required integration points.

## Acceptance criteria

1. First sync enable triggers bootstrap/merge without restart.
2. Merge behavior is deterministic and preserves local usability.
3. Convergence flush occurs after merge and updates sync metadata on success.
4. Failure path keeps local data intact and retryable, honoring `should_retry` + `error_index` semantics.
5. Tests cover the logged-out-then-login bootstrap journey up to convergence.

## Docs touched (required)

- `docs/specs/milestones/M13-simple-backend-sync.md` - align with implemented merge behavior.
- `docs/specs/03-technical-architecture.md` - update planned/adopted language if behavior stabilizes.
- `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md` - update coverage policy if needed.
- `docs/specs/tech/client-sync-engine.md` - update end-to-end flow, failure-mode, and subsystem interaction sections for implemented bootstrap/merge/convergence behavior.

## Testing and verification approach

- Planned checks/commands:
  - targeted frontend integration tests for bootstrap/merge
  - cross-stack local integration check against backend ingest/projection
  - `./scripts/quality-fast.sh`
  - `./scripts/quality-slow.sh` when runtime-sensitive flows are changed
- Test layers covered:
  - integration
  - contract
  - cross-stack smoke

## Implementation notes

- Planned files/areas allowed to change:
  - `apps/mobile/src/**`
  - `apps/mobile/app/__tests__/**`
  - integration harness/scripts as needed
- Project structure impact:
  - none expected

## Mandatory verify gates

- Standard local fast gate: `./scripts/quality-fast.sh`
- Standard local slow gate: `./scripts/quality-slow.sh` when risk triggers apply

## Evidence

- Targeted frontend suites:
  - `npm run test -- app/__tests__/sync-bootstrap-merge.test.ts app/__tests__/sync-runtime-bootstrap.test.ts app/__tests__/root-layout-auth-bootstrap.test.tsx` (`pass`)
- Gate summaries:
  - `./scripts/quality-fast.sh frontend` (`pass`; existing repo lint warnings only)
  - `./scripts/quality-slow.sh frontend` (`pass`; smoke, data-smoke, and auth-profile Maestro flows)
- Convergence/failure proof notes:
  - `sync-bootstrap-merge.test.ts` verifies deterministic merge winner selection and convergence loop terminal behavior.
  - `sync-runtime-bootstrap.test.ts` verifies first-enable + logged-out-then-login bootstrap trigger paths.
  - Existing `sync-outbox-engine.test.ts` coverage remains for failure mapping (`failure_retry_scheduled`, `failure_blocked`) and ingest response contract handling.

## Completion note (fill at end)

- What changed:
  - Added first-enable sync runtime state persistence (`sync_runtime_state`) and migration `m0008`.
  - Implemented `apps/mobile/src/sync/bootstrap.ts` for remote projection fetch, deterministic local-vs-remote merge, transactional local apply, and local convergence-event enqueue.
  - Implemented `apps/mobile/src/sync/runtime.ts` for auth-gated transport wiring, first-enable/bootstrap trigger orchestration, and convergence flushing via `flushSyncOutboxUntilSettled`.
  - Wired runtime start/stop into root layout startup.
  - Added targeted tests for merge determinism, convergence-loop behavior, and logged-out-then-login bootstrap trigger orchestration.
  - Updated milestone/architecture/data-model/testing/sync-engine docs to reflect adopted bootstrap/merge/convergence behavior.
- What tests ran:
  - `npm run test -- app/__tests__/sync-bootstrap-merge.test.ts app/__tests__/sync-runtime-bootstrap.test.ts app/__tests__/root-layout-auth-bootstrap.test.tsx`
  - `./scripts/quality-fast.sh frontend`
  - `./scripts/quality-slow.sh frontend`
- What remains:
  - `M13-T05` for profile sync UX/status presentation and explicit journey evidence in UI flows.
  - `M13-T06` for reinstall restore-state parity verification.
