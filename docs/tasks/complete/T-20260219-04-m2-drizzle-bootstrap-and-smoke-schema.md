## Objective

Create the minimum Drizzle + SQLite foundation in `apps/mobile` with one infrastructure-only smoke table and initial migration artifacts.

## Scope

### In scope

- Add required local storage dependencies for Drizzle + Expo SQLite usage.
- Add a dedicated local data-layer bootstrap module.
- Define one smoke table schema for infrastructure verification only.
- Add migration configuration and generate initial migration output.
- Add basic wiring so the app codebase can import DB bootstrap safely.

### Out of scope

- Runtime migration execution behavior.
- Smoke insert/read integration flow.
- Any `Session -> Exercise -> Set` or gym/machine schema.
- UI feature changes unrelated to data bootstrap safety.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Drizzle + SQLite dependencies/config are added and compile in `apps/mobile`.
2. A single smoke schema table is defined and included in generated migration artifacts.
3. No workout-domain tables or repositories are introduced.
4. Lane 1 setup is in place with a migration-generation canary command documented for CI/local verification.
5. `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` pass in `apps/mobile`.

## Testing and verification approach (follow `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`)

- Planned checks/commands:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - migration-generation canary command (to be added in this task)
- Notes:
  - Task focus is Lane 1 foundation (tooling + compile-time readiness); runtime native validation is deferred to `T-20260219-05`.

## Implementation notes

- Planned files/areas allowed to change: `apps/mobile/package.json`, `apps/mobile/drizzle.config.*`, `apps/mobile/src/data/**`, `apps/mobile/drizzle/**`
- Constraints/assumptions:
  - Keep naming generic (infrastructure smoke only).
  - Use minimal schema shape (`id`, value payload, timestamps) without domain semantics.
  - Avoid introducing app-level domain repository abstractions in this task.

## Mandatory verify gates

- `npm run lint` (from `apps/mobile`)
- `npm run typecheck` (from `apps/mobile`)
- `npm run test` (from `apps/mobile`, run at closeout even if unchanged)

## Evidence (follow `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`)

- `npm run db:generate:canary` (from `apps/mobile`) -> pass; generated `apps/mobile/drizzle/0000_quiet_famine.sql` and `apps/mobile/drizzle/meta/*`
- `npm run lint` (from `apps/mobile`) -> pass
- `npm run typecheck` (from `apps/mobile`) -> pass
- `npm run test` (from `apps/mobile`) -> pass (`2` suites, `6` tests)

## Completion note (fill at end per `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`)

- Added Lane 1 local-data bootstrap: `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`, `expo-sqlite`, `drizzle.config.ts`, smoke-only schema, and lazy DB bootstrap module under `apps/mobile/src/data/**`.
- Added migration-generation canary scripts in `apps/mobile/package.json` and documented local/CI usage in `apps/mobile/README.md`.
- Generated initial smoke migration artifacts under `apps/mobile/drizzle/**` with one non-domain table (`smoke_records`) and no workout-domain schema.
- Wired safe bootstrap import usage in `apps/mobile/app/_layout.tsx` via `bootstrapLocalDataLayer()` with no runtime migration execution added in this task.
- Remaining work (intended for `T-20260219-05`): runtime migration execution behavior and smoke insert/read integration coverage.
