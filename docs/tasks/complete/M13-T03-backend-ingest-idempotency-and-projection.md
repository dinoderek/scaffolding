## Objective

Implement backend event ingest and projection so outbox events are applied idempotently and restorable backup state stays coherent.

## Scope

### In scope

- Add authenticated ingest endpoint(s) for batched events.
- Enforce idempotency by `event_id` and ordering by `(device_id, sequence_in_device)`.
- Persist event ingest metadata required for strict in-order processing.
- Project applied events into restorable user-state tables/read models.
- Add backend contract tests for success, duplicate replay, ordering, and denial paths.

### Out of scope

- Frontend outbox emission logic.
- Profile UI work.
- End-to-end mobile Maestro verification.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Event ingest response contract is minimal: `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE` with `error_index`, optional `error_event_id`, `should_retry`, and free-text `message`.
2. Duplicate event replay is idempotent.
3. Batch processing is strict request-order with stop-on-first-failure and prefix-commit behavior.
4. Projection state remains coherent for all M13 data-scope entities.
5. Backend auth/RLS denial paths are tested.
6. Backend fast/slow quality gates pass.

## Docs touched (required)

- `supabase/session-sync-api-contract.md` - ingest/ack/projection contract details.
- `docs/specs/05-data-model.md` - backend model updates for projection storage.
- `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md` - backend sync verification expectations.
- `docs/specs/milestones/M13-simple-backend-sync.md` - align technical approach details if needed.
- `docs/specs/tech/client-sync-engine.md` - update client/backend interaction, failure-mode, and test-overview sections impacted by ingest/projection behavior changes.

## Testing and verification approach

- Planned checks/commands:
  - backend unit/contract tests for ingest/projection
  - `./scripts/quality-fast.sh backend`
  - `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend`
- Test layers covered:
  - db/constraint
  - contract/integration
  - local runtime smoke

## Implementation notes

- Planned files/areas allowed to change:
  - `supabase/migrations/**`
  - `supabase/functions/**` (if ingest endpoint uses functions)
  - `supabase/tests/**`
  - `supabase/scripts/**`
- Project structure impact:
  - no top-level structure change expected

## Mandatory verify gates

- Standard local fast gate: `./scripts/quality-fast.sh backend`
- Standard local slow gate: `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend`

## Evidence

- backend contract test outputs
- idempotency/replay proof summary
- projection correctness checks

## Completion note (fill at end)

- What changed: added migration `supabase/migrations/20260306170000_m13_sync_events_ingest_projection.sql` implementing M13 ingest metadata tables, full-scope projection tables/columns/constraints/RLS, and RPC endpoint `app_public.sync_events_ingest` with strict request-order processing, stop-on-first-failure, prefix commit, idempotency by `(owner_user_id, device_id, event_id)`, and projection apply dispatch; added backend contract suite `supabase/tests/sync-events-ingest-contract.sh` plus wrapper `supabase/scripts/test-sync-events-ingest-contract.sh`; wired the new suite into `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend`; updated required specs/docs (`supabase/session-sync-api-contract.md`, `docs/specs/05-data-model.md`, `docs/specs/06-testing-strategy.md`, `docs/specs/tech/client-sync-engine.md`, and `docs/specs/milestones/M13-simple-backend-sync.md`).
- What tests ran: `./supabase/scripts/test-sync-events-ingest-contract.sh`; `./scripts/quality-fast.sh backend`; `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend`.
- What remains: M13-T04 (`bootstrap/merge/convergence`) and M13-T05 (`profile UX + end-to-end integration`) remain open.
