## Objective

Bootstrap the Expo Router TypeScript app at `apps/mobile` and ensure root route `/` renders the baseline message `Milestone 0 foundation ready`.

## Scope

### In scope

- Scaffold Expo app at `apps/mobile`.
- Ensure Expo Router entry structure is correct.
- Implement baseline root route message.
- Add minimal README run instructions for local startup.

### Out of scope

- Jest/test configuration.
- Lint/typecheck/test scripts implementation.
- CI integration.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `apps/mobile` exists and installs successfully.
2. App starts with Expo and root route is reachable.
3. Root route displays exact text: `Milestone 0 foundation ready`.
4. Route/file structure follows Expo Router conventions.

## Delivery split mode

- Mode: `split`
- Rationale: Foundation app scaffold should land before test/gate wiring to keep bootstrap failures isolated.

If `split`, define cards:

- Test-first card: `N/A` for this card.
- Implementation card: `T-20260215-02`

## Test plan

### Required tests

1. Manual runtime smoke check in Expo Go/simulator for root message.
2. Static check that route path `/` resolves to root screen file.

### Red phase (expected failing tests)

- Target command(s): `test -d apps/mobile`
- Expected failure reason: App directory does not exist before scaffold.

### Green phase (expected passing tests)

- Target command(s): `test -d apps/mobile && rg -n "Milestone 0 foundation ready" apps/mobile`
- Pass criteria: Directory exists and exact string is present in root route.

### Evidence to capture

- Command(s) run: `npx create-expo-app ...`, `npx expo start --offline` (or equivalent), `rg`, `git diff`
- Result summary: App scaffolded and message visible.

## Implementation notes

- Planned files/areas allowed to change: `apps/mobile/**`
- Constraints/assumptions:
  - Use Expo Router TypeScript starter.
  - Keep implementation minimal; no extra features.

## Mandatory verify gates

- `npm run lint` (temporarily exempt if not yet implemented; per bootstrap exception)
- `npm run typecheck` (temporarily exempt if not yet implemented; per bootstrap exception)
- `npm run test` (temporarily exempt if not yet implemented; per bootstrap exception)
- Additional gate(s), if any: App startup smoke check must pass

## Escalation settings

- Max verify attempts before escalation: `3` (default)
- Escalation template: `docs/specs/templates/escalation-note-template.md`
- Escalation file path (if blocked): `docs/tasks/escalations/E-T-20260215-02-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.md`

## Automated review loop (before human review)

- AI self-review completed: `yes`
- Checks reviewed:
  - Acceptance criteria coverage
  - Test completeness
  - Offline/edge-case handling
  - Security/data access impact
- CI status: `pending`

## Completion note (fill at end)

- What changed: Scaffolded Expo app in `apps/mobile` using `create-expo-app` default (Expo Router entry in `package.json`), added root route `apps/mobile/app/index.tsx` with exact text `Milestone 0 foundation ready`, updated `apps/mobile/app/_layout.tsx` to include `index` in stack, and replaced `apps/mobile/README.md` with minimal local startup instructions.
- Tests run and outcome: Red check `test -d apps/mobile` failed before scaffold (`exit 1`); green static check `test -d apps/mobile && rg -n "Milestone 0 foundation ready" apps/mobile` passed; static route structure check for `apps/mobile/app/index.tsx` and `apps/mobile/app/_layout.tsx` passed; manual runtime smoke check passed via human confirmation that `npx expo start --offline` started successfully and displayed the required root message.
- Verify gate outcomes: Attempted root-level `npm run lint` and it failed with `ENOENT` due missing `/home/dino/codex-tests/package.json`; `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test` are not implemented at repo root in this bootstrap stage. Per Milestone 0 bootstrap exception in `docs/specs/04-ai-development-playbook.md`, verify gates are temporarily exempt for this task while required scripts are not yet available.
- AI self-review findings/resolution: Acceptance criteria fully met (scaffold exists, Expo Router root path present, exact message implemented, startup smoke evidence captured); no architecture or security impact beyond scaffold baseline.
- CI result: `pending` (CI quality gates not configured in this bootstrap task).
- Follow-up tasks: `docs/tasks/complete/T-20260215-03-m0-testing-and-quality-gates.md`.
- Escalation link (if blocked): `n/a`
