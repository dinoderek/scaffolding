# Sync redesign — follow-ups

Items uncovered during the redesign that are out of scope for the current task set but
worth a future pass. Sorted by priority.

## P1 — quality gate enforcement

**Question:** when and how do we enforce that all relevant quality gates run before merge?

**Why this matters:** Today the gates are honor-system. T1, T3, T4 merged without anyone
running `quality-slow.sh backend` (which contains the auth-authz, M5 PostgREST, and M13
ingest contract suites). T3 also merged with a missing `_journal.json` entry that
`drizzle-kit check` would have caught. The execution-contract patch (PR #14) made the
expectation explicit, but that's a docs rule, not a runtime enforcement.

**Status:** Today none of the gates are wired into CI for PRs. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
exists but only covers frontend lint/typecheck/test on `apps/mobile`.

**Decisions needed:**
1. Should `./scripts/quality-fast.sh` (both areas) run on every PR via CI? Cheap; should
   probably be unconditional.
2. Should `./scripts/quality-slow.sh backend` run on PRs touching `supabase/`,
   `apps/mobile/src/sync/`, or the contract doc? It needs a local Supabase stack — CI
   would have to spin one up. Cost: ~minutes per PR. Probably worth it for those paths.
3. Should `./scripts/quality-slow.sh frontend` (Maestro e2e) be CI-enforced or stay manual?
   Highest cost; UI-touching PRs only. Probably manual for now.
4. Does `drizzle-kit check` need a CI step? Quick (sub-second). Should be unconditional —
   would have caught T3's journal omission.

**Suggested ownership:** open a follow-up task once T7 (hosted DB reset) lands. CI changes
shouldn't compete with Wave 3.

## P2 — Drizzle journal/snapshot drift

T2's rebase agent fixed `_journal.json` for entries 10 and 11. But `meta/0010_snapshot.json`
was never created (T3 omitted it; T2's 0011 chains directly to 0006 in the snapshot graph).

**Action:** small follow-up PR to backfill `meta/0010_snapshot.json` and re-link
`meta/0011_snapshot.json`'s `prevId` to point at 0010 instead of 0006. `drizzle-kit
introspect` from a clean main checkout, then commit. Low priority; functional impact zero
(runtime migrator uses a separate hand-maintained bundle).

## P3 — Sequence counter / device id sharing across users on same device

Per the original plan deferral: `device_id` and `nextSequenceInDevice` are singleton on
device. After user A signs out and user B signs in, B's events use the same device_id and
continue A's sequence numbers. Backend tolerates it (per-user sequence space) but it's
messy. Hardening: reset `device_id` and sequence on user switch.

## P4 — Cross-device delete propagation for gyms / session_exercises / exercise_sets

Per original plan deferral: these tables have no local `deletedAt` column, so the merge's
`includeRemote: row.deletedAtMs === null` filter drops remote tombstones, and a row deleted
on another device is undeletable from this device's perspective.

**Action when prioritized:** add `deletedAt` to the affected local schemas, drop the merge
filter, ensure the convergence event emits a `delete` for tombstoned rows.

## P5 — Seed version drift across app upgrades

Per original plan deferral: with T8 ("seed once") landed, new seeds in future app versions
will never reach existing installs. New users get the new bundle; existing users keep
their original catalog.

**Action when prioritized:** introduce a `seed_version` per row OR a "seeds present in
bundle but not in local DB → insert (no overwrite)" check.

## P6 — `supabase/hosted-bootstrap-sync.sql` is stale

T1 reviewer flagged: this file still has old PK definitions and "different owner" branches.
The hosted DB will be reset in T7, which makes the file obsolete OR will need
regeneration. Decide and act in T7.

## P7 — Add CI assertion for orphan Drizzle SQL files

Per the sweep agent: `drizzle-kit check` only validates entries in `_journal.json`, so it
can't detect orphan SQL files (a `0010_*.sql` with no journal entry passes). A small CI
script could grep `apps/mobile/drizzle/*.sql` against `_journal.json` and fail on mismatch.
Would have caught T3's omission directly.
