# Supabase Local Runtime (M5 Baseline)

This folder is the backend root for M5 (`Supabase` local-first development and testing).

## Purpose (T-20260220-08)

- Provide a reproducible local backend runtime scaffold.
- Prove migration + reset/seed flow from a clean local state.
- Expose a health endpoint for explicit API-surface smoke checks.
- Establish backend-local smoke test and fixture conventions for follow-on M5 tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Docker-compatible container runtime (Docker Desktop verified in this repo session).
- `npx`/`npm` available (repo scripts use `npx supabase@2.76.15` by default).
- Optional: install Supabase CLI globally (`supabase`) if preferred, but repo scripts do not require it.

## Local environment configuration strategy

- Run `./scripts/worktree-setup.sh` from the repo root before local runtime use.
- Checked-in Supabase config is `supabase/config.toml.template`.
- Generated per-worktree config is `supabase/config.toml` and is gitignored.
- Local script overrides: `supabase/.env.local`
  - setup links this to `~/.config/boga/supabase/cli.env`
  - currently used for script-level config like `SUPABASE_CLI_VERSION`
- Local function env vars: `supabase/functions/.env.local`
  - setup links this to `~/.config/boga/edge-functions/env.shared`
  - used by `supabase functions serve --env-file ...`
- Hosted placeholders (no secrets committed): `supabase/.env.hosted`
  - setup links this to `~/.config/boga/supabase/env.hosted`
  - detailed hosted env/deployment command path is owned by `T-20260220-09`

## One-command local startup path

Run from repo root:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/local-runtime-up.sh
```

What it does:

1. Starts the Supabase local stack (`supabase start` via pinned `npx`).
2. Opportunistically sweeps completed worktree Supabase infra before startup.
3. Starts the local Edge Function server for `health` (background process).
4. Waits until `GET /functions/v1/health` responds.

Stop the local runtime:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/local-runtime-down.sh
```

Sweep completed/orphaned worktree Supabase infra:

```bash
./scripts/worktree-sweep.sh
```

## Deterministic local reset/seed path

Run from repo root:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/reset-local.sh
```

This wraps `supabase db reset --local --yes` and applies:

- `supabase/migrations/*` (baseline schema/bootstrap)
- `supabase/seed.sql` (deterministic test fixtures)

## Local smoke checks

Health endpoint:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/smoke-health.sh
```

Seed fixture baseline (via local Supabase REST API):

```bash
./supabase/scripts/smoke-seed.sh
```

Combined fast backend-local check (current baseline for this task):

```bash
./supabase/scripts/test-fast.sh
```

Shared runtime baseline preflight for real-instance contract/E2E flows:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/ensure-local-runtime-baseline.sh
```

Behavior:

1. If local Supabase is not running, it starts the stack, resets/seeds DB, and provisions deterministic auth fixtures.
2. If local Supabase is already running, it reuses that instance as-is (no reset), verifies baseline seed fixtures, and reprovisions auth fixtures idempotently.
3. Bootstrap/reset path is lock-protected so concurrent callers on one machine do not race startup.

Current coverage:

- local stack bring-up
- migrations + reset + seed
- DB lint (`supabase db lint --fail-on error`)
- Edge health endpoint smoke
- deterministic fixture seed smoke

## M5 auth/authz baseline (implemented in `T-20260220-10`)

Current auth posture for backend/API work:

- `Supabase Auth` + Postgres `RLS`
- `email + password` sign-in for provisioned users
- public self-signup disabled (`[auth].enable_signup = false`)
- email provider kept enabled for password logins (`[auth.email].enable_signup = true`)
- user-owned sync tables live in `app_public` and are protected by `RLS`
- `gyms`, `sessions`, `session_exercises`, and `exercise_sets` are user-private in MVP

### Key boundaries (must keep)

- `anon` key is client-safe and used with user JWTs for normal app data access.
- `service_role` is server/admin only (provisioning, maintenance, tightly scoped backend tasks).
- Never expose `service_role` to mobile/client code.

## Auth provisioning (controlled users, no self-signup)

Provision deterministic local auth fixtures (`user_a`, `user_b`) after local reset:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/auth-provision-local-fixtures.sh
```

Provision or update one user (local or any environment where `API_URL` + `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are exported):

```bash
./supabase/scripts/auth-provision-user.sh \
  --email user@example.test \
  --password 'StrongPassword!234'
```

Notes:

- Uses the Supabase Auth Admin API (service-role only).
- Local fixture provisioning also syncs `public.dev_fixture_principals` aliases (`user_a`, `user_b`) to the real local auth user UUIDs for deterministic ownership tests.

## Auth/authz contract tests (local Supabase)

Run the M5 auth/authz baseline suite:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/test-auth-authz.sh
```

This wrapper enforces the shared runtime baseline first (`ensure-local-runtime-baseline.sh`) and then runs the contract suite.

Coverage includes:

- password auth success/failure
- self-signup disabled path
- unauthenticated access denial on protected tables
- cross-user read/update denial (`RLS`)
- owner spoofing denial
- cross-user parent/child ownership mismatch rejection (DB constraint path)

## M5 sync API contract baseline (implemented in `T-20260220-11`)

Chosen API surface for the M5 sync baseline:

- `PostgREST` table routes on `app_public` (`gyms`, `sessions`, `session_exercises`, `exercise_sets`)
- auth via `anon` key + user JWT
- authorization via table `RLS` + FK/check constraints

Provider-neutral method catalog + Supabase mapping:

- `supabase/session-sync-api-contract.md`

Local sync API contract suite:

```bash
./supabase/scripts/test-sync-api-contract.sh
```

This wrapper enforces the shared runtime baseline first (`ensure-local-runtime-baseline.sh`) and then runs the sync contract suite.

Coverage includes success read/write flows, validation failures, unauthenticated denial, and cross-user denial across all sync-domain entities, including session metadata parity fields (`session_exercises.exercise_definition_id`, `exercise_sets.set_type`).

Parallel-run note:

- each initialized BOGA worktree gets slot-derived Supabase ports, `project_id`, containers, and database volume.
- the sync/auth contract suites use per-run unique record IDs, so repeated runs in one slot do not collide.
- tests require the deterministic fixture baseline to exist but do not require empty app tables.
- run `./scripts/worktree-doctor.sh` when a backend suite appears to hit another worktree's local runtime.

## Accessing `app_public` via REST (local/manual testing)

`app_public` is exposed in the local API config. For direct `PostgREST` calls, send schema profile headers:

- `Accept-Profile: app_public`
- `Content-Profile: app_public` (writes)

## Fixture baseline (deterministic)

`supabase/seed.sql` seeds `public.dev_fixture_principals` with named fixtures used by follow-on ownership/authz tests:

- `anonymous`
- `user_a`
- `user_b`
- `service_role_helper` (optional helper fixture)

These are dev fixtures only and do **not** lock the final auth linkage design for M5 auth/sync tasks.

## Health endpoint note

The `health` Edge Function is a local runtime smoke surface only. It exists to validate:

- local stack reachability
- local Edge Function serving path
- deterministic endpoint smoke checks

It does **not** lock the final sync API surface choice for `T-20260220-11` (`Edge Functions` vs `PostgREST/RPC` mix).

## Follow-on testing layers (documented now, implemented incrementally)

- `DB` tests: `pgTAP` (`supabase test db`) for policies/functions/constraints
- `Edge` unit tests: add when Edge logic beyond simple health exists
- `Supabase-local` integration/contract tests: required for auth/RLS/API tasks
- hosted smoke validation: owned by `T-20260220-09` (manual by default until CI exists)
- cross-stack `E2E`: strategy only in M5; repo-root `e2e/` reserved for later implementation
